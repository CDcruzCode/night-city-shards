You work on the top floor of a skyscraper while I pick trash off the curb 100 floors down. But for those rare exceptions where we do it usually ends in tragedy.<br><br>Two weeks ago you hit a young woman with your car. The hour was late, it was dark, no one saw a thing. If you had stopped and called for an ambulance she might still be alive. But I guess you had and important meeting over cocktails to get to. That girl bled out on the sidewalk.<br><br>Her name was Rosita and she was my daughter. You made me bury her. Ever since she was born I set aside every spare enny I could for her education. But that money won't go to waste. It's all going to a good cause: the hired killer who's going to blow a hole through your arrogant brain.<br><br>Marlon Fuscino

Please forgive me.<br><br>HIDEO ITO: Mom, you could rack your brains for A THOUSAND YEARS and you still wouldn't understand why I left.<br><br>SATOKO ITO: Please help me understand, then. I'm sending you a picture of your sister. [FILE UNAVAILABLE] Did you know she's eight years old already? She asks about you constantly. She bears our name, which you may still cleanse of the shame you brought on it. Come back, and we will forget all about your little stunts with those pretend gangsters of yours.<br><br>HIDEO ITO: No, I don't believe you. "Shame" is the only thing you deserve. As for my sister (whose name is Sakura, as I'm sure you forgot), I am sure she will repay you as well someday for the way you treat her.<br><br>HIDEO ITO: Thanks for the picture.

JOANNE KOCH: As a world-renouned scientist yourself, I'm sure you've heard of the groundbreaking "Nightingale" program, which I'm undertaking as part of my corporate contract.<br><br>DR. JOANNE KOCH: Due to the growing interest in my work among people who, unfortunately, cannot understand the sacrifice that the work of science demands, I'm looking for a temporary bas of operations to continue my research without fear for my health or life.<br><br>DR. JOANNE KOCH: I'm certain that an outstanding specialist such as you will understand that great discoveries necessarily require the appropriate conditions which I desperately lack.<br><br>DR. JOANNE KOCH: Thank you in advance.<br><br>DR. FIONA VARGAS: Hello, Dr. Koch. Indeed, I've heard of the "Nightingale" program - more than I would've liked.<br><br>DR. FIONA VARGAS: For that reason, I must politely, but firmly decline your request.<br><br>DR. FIONA VARGAS: My profesional[sic] practice has always remained true to medical ethics and the well-being of my patients, of whom all - without exception - have consented to undergo the care offered to them.<br><br>DR. FIONA VARGAS: Respect for human life is the foundation of my worldview, which you clearly do not share.<br><br>DR. FIONA VARGAS: Offering you any assistance to continue conducting your research would be in direct conflict with my conscience.<br><br>DR. FIONA VARGAS: Please do not contact me again.

Well buckle up, gonks, we're going on a wild pilgrimage around Dogtown's Stations of the Lost!<br><br>FIRST STATION: Regular meets with nova beats and preem "sweets" by that basketball court in the center of Dogtown, nestled at the very heart of our delusional journey. Strangers give you candy, you eat it, you sit back and watch as reality smooths over, the air turns fresh, the sun warm... just don't forget to drink plenty of water!<br><br>SECOND STATION: Just a hop, skip and a jump and you're at the scav party by Organitopia. What's a choom to do in a sad, drab world of gray where good intentions, good words and good deeds mean nothing? Grab some phant – one whiff and you're gone (though the world stays).<br><br>THIRD STATION: You scan that big metal sphere? The naked frame of the world, sans skin, sans brain, sans teeth, sans everything? The sharp edges that lie hidden just under reality's veil of tears? That globe that resembles a world gone barren, the oceans turned to dust, the earth rotted off a worm-eaten skeleton of chrome as great as our longing for meaning in this mortal coil? Yeah they party there too.<br><br>FOURTH (FINAL) STATION: There's this little teeny tiny spot in a container in the Stacks. Go ahead, crawl in, reenter the womb, dance around or lie down on the ground and pulse along with the musical contractions. Some end up staying for good, 'cause what's the point of leaving?			yes

Article	A Family of Empire	A FAMILY OF EMPIRE<br><br>The legacy of Arasaka needs no introduction. The Arasaka Corporation is one of the world's most powerful, with offices located in every major metropolis across the globe. For years, it has been behind the proverbial wheel of our planet's economy and society. The history of Arasaka in Night City is deserving of its own article, but suffice to say, the media industry in our city follows the family behind the megacorp as closely as they do share prices.<br><br>The story of the Arasaka family is one of empire – a true dynasty under the rule of patriarch Saburo Arasaka. Rumors of the great Saburo's retirement and cession of company control (as well as of its closely guarded secrets) to his daughter, Hanako, and son, Yorinobu, have come and passed in recent years. But has the time come where such rumors may finally contain a grain of truth?<br><br>Our sources report that Yorinobu Arasaka is currently in Night City, but not for a social call. And yet, if Yorinobu is strategizing a move for the throne, what of Hanako? Experts who follow the family closely unanimously agree that – due to "ideological" differences between Saburo and Yorinobu – Hanako will likely cement herself as the one true heir to the immense fortune and power of the Arasaka family. However, reality is hardly ever so predictable. Familial power dynamics can shift in an instant. For example, what would happen if Hanako fell from favor at a time when Yorinobu had his father's ear? And what scenario might cause such a fall?<br><br>No family is without its secrets, and the Arasakas are no exception. After all... "What appears first as heaven, appears second as hell." – Japanese proverb.<br>generic_arasaka_family_backstory_shard			
Article	A neon typhoon is about to hit America! It's US CRACKS and their NEW, SHOCKING SINGLE!	A NEON TYPHOON IS ABOUT TO HIT AMERICA! IT'S US CRACKS AND THEIR NEW, SHOCKING SINGLE!<br><br>They have names like superheroes and a brand image that explodes off screen and stage. Us Cracks is a band perfectly suited to the mania of our time. If you want to stand out in this world, you have to be bigger, brighter, and louder than every ad out there and they know it! The girls of Us Cracks have become a worldwide lazrpop phenomenon. This masterpiece of marketing grew fast in the East, becoming a neon typhoon that swept over Asia, drowned Europe in a flashy, chromatic glow, and now is about to make landfall in America.<br><br>Will we succumb to their savage cuteness and brutal charms? There's no doubt they have a plan to conquer both our hearts and our wallets. Purple Force and her kawaii cohort plan to target a piece of the American soul: our unique combination of rebelliousness and sentimentality. That's why the single they have chose to promote on the American leg of their tour is a cover of Kerry Eurodyne hit "User Friendly." A crowd-pleasing but also question-raising choice. Could it be Us Cracks wants to present themselves to the American audience as a "user-friendly" craze to be embraced? Or is it maybe some sort of playful jab at the American consumer? Whatever their reason, the more interesting question now is how Eurodyne himself has reacted to the erection of this intergenerational and intercultural bridge with him standing on one side of it. So far, the rockerboy has refused to comment and I think we all know what that means...<br><br>Kerry and the girls from Us Cracks are still holding an ace up their sleeve.			
Article	A wicked acid trip, but not the kind you think!	A WICKED ACID TRIP, BUT NOT THE KIND YOU THINK!<br><br>Ever wondered what it feels like to fall in a pool of acid? Well, wonder no more! (sort of)<br><br>Before I ever even got my copy of "Kings of Acid" my curiosity took a nosedive once I found out it wasn't about THAT type of acid... In any case, body horror has such a rich tradition it's a damn near herculean task to find a fresh angle to take on acid baths. But holy shit did the devs do it!<br><br>You play as Artur Kerr, a klutzy and somewhat awkward rockerboy, who gets himself tangled up in a shitstrom[sic] with Maelstrom. The borg goons entrust Kerr with handling a mysterious shipment containing a protozoa capable of instantaneous regeneration. But in an unlucky twist (a painfully common occurrence for our hero), a rival gang ambushes the exchange at a corp science lab and Kerr is pushed into a vat of mutagenic acid. That's when the "trip" kicks in, if you will. The rockerboy begins undergoing constant mutations - eyeballs on stalks, shifting skin, throat tentacles, and that's not even the real freaky stuff!<br><br>After every victory in combat, Artur absorbs the genetic code from the blood splatter of his foes, making the already delightful hack 'n' slash combat even more gratifying. The constantly growing spiral of possible mutations makes for a rewarding way to spend experience points and builds in strong replayability.<br><br>All in all, Kerr's ultimate motivation is seeking bloody revenge against his music producer who cost him a lucrative album deal and brutally murdered the rockerboy's boyfriend. Story and gameplay are geniously intertwined, and the pseudo-braindance implant shipped with each game copy really helps immerse players in the utterly fucked mutations, where searing pain turns to power-jacked ecstasy. Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this one!

Article	Arasaka and Ornithology: Three Japanese Words to Know	ARASAKA AND ORNITHOLOGY: THREE JAPANESE WORDS TO KNOW<br><br>As conversations over factionalism within Arasaka heat up, many industry insiders wonder about the company's future trajectory. If you struggle to understand the complicated inner machinations of the world's largest arms manufacturer, look no further than the obscure science of ornithology. Yes, that's right; the study of birds can help. At least, in a sense. There are three Japanese words every corporate player ought to be familiar with: kiji, hato, and taka.<br><br>Kiji - green pheasant. This bird has long held cultural and symbolic significance in Japan. One can admire the world's last living specimens at Hanako Arasaka's private preserve on the island of Shikoku. But the word "kiji" also bears meaning among the factional identities within Arasaka. This group, with Hanako at its center, consists primarily of conservative technocrats who wish to follow the course set by Saburo Arasaka himself.<br>In his daughter, Hanako, they see a guiding force to maintain the old order and stability within the corporation..<br><br>Hato - dove. The symbolism of the dove is recognized far and wide. The symbol also aptly captures the character of the a much smaller faction within the company led by Michiko Arasaka, daughter of the late Kei and niece to Hanako.* This liberal wing of the corporation has unified those who seek deeper reforms. Although they currently hold little influence, they enjoy growing support popularity among some politicians and media personalities.<br><br>Taka - hawk. As symbolic as the dove is, so, too, is the hawk. This faction, headed by Yorinobu Arasaka, often prefers to take the most direct and uncompromising solutions. Both stubborn and temperamental, he resembles Saburo which has given him wide support among the more militant-minded Arasaka Corp. elite. However, his more pro-Western inclinations and ideas that are innovative as they are controversial have weakened his support from the Board's loyal traditionalists.<br><br>* You can learn more about Arasaka family genealogy from the eight-book series "Two Centuries in the Clover's Shadow."

Article	B.A. Guseinov, 'Respiration and Intercellular Spaces.'	B.A. GUSEINOV, "RESPIRATION AND INTERCELLULAR SPACES."<br><br>(1) The theory of imperil, though overly simplistic and never formulated along the lines required by modern scientific inquiry, is in fact useful as a general principle. Scientists today are all too ready to consign visionaries of previous ages to the dustbin of history simply because they deal with questions of spirituality, putting them supposedly at odds with contemporary theories.<br><br>(2) If indeed a person has a Self, how can we therefore doubt that the Self affects the body? If it exists, then it must exercise influence. In fact, this was proven only a few weeks ago by a group of scientists at the University of Toledo. A study conducted on laboratory mice showed a correlation between regular meditation and a 20% increase in lifespan.<br><br>Bibliography:<br><br>"The fatal effects of modern shamanism." I.E.

Article	Biased guide on Dogtown - Night City's Wild West	BIASED GUIDE ON DOGTOWN - NIGHT CITY'S WILD WEST<br><br>You in Night City? Seen all highlights: Corpo Plaza, North Oak, Japantown, even the Trauma Hospital and other places the NC authorities can be proud of? Then it's now time for Dogtown, the part of Night City that those in power would like to forget... if they could.<br><br>Start with my guide to NC to get a good taste of what awaits you beyond the gates to Dogtown - if Pacifica, Heywood or Santo Domingo don't finish you off and you're in the mood for more, I have the perfect DT tour for you:<br><br>Stop 1 - The Gate<br><br>Just getting to Dogtown is an adventure of sorts, and even seeing the gate is worth the trek through Pacifica. And if its size or the guards, armed to the teeth, don't intimidate you - hit me up and I'll get you the paperwork to pass inspection - for a fee, of course. Dogtown, obviously, does not offer official tourist visas, but here, anything can be arranged.<br><br>Stop 2 - Black Sapphire<br><br>On your left you'll see a huge tower - the Black Sapphire Hotel. It was supposed to be synonymous with luxury and power, to shock and awe the downtrodden citizen. It works, albeit in a more somber way. Particularly noteworthy is the very ground floor of the building, extending downward, reminiscent of gilded buttresses. They give the building a Gothic sort of vibe.<br><br>WARNING: do not try to enter Black Sapphire by force. You will be STERNLY stopped by BARGHEST.<br><br>Stop 3 - "Jason Exiled"<br><br>Across the street you'll see a great, big head - that's "Jason Exiled," the latest work of a renowned monumentalist Imelda Ayala Carballo. For some, it is the incorporation of the sculpture into Eden Plaza and the shopping arcade that directly connects to the casino that is the artist's greatest achievement. According to some, however, she couldn't've known about the final shape of the place, so the context here is coincidental and Carballo simply sold her final work to the highest bidder.<br><br>Stop 4 - Stadium<br><br>A must-see spot - an extensive marketplace stocked with everything your heart desires. Nobody wants to crank up your synaptic accelerator into overload? Here, surely someone already will. Your dream operating system is sold out everywhere? Somewhere in the Stadium you're likely to find a prototype of the next generation. Want to get a tattoo? Ya got it. Hungry? Grab a bite! Incendiary ammo? Spill some eddies and the world's your oyster!<br><br>Stop 5 - Tranquil Terrace<br><br>The green refuge of the neighborhood, though quite wilted by now. From here you'll have a nice view of Dogtown. Just be careful, don't act like a fool, VDBs roam the area and they're don't want no tomfoolery on their turf. On the left you will see a hill with a "departing" rocket. That's your next stop.<br><br>Stop 6 - Terra Cognita<br><br>The remains of (what was meant to be) a cutting-edge technological park. Cemetary[sic] of progress, forgotten novelties, abandoned dreams. I especially recommend Organitopia. There's a bunch of holodinosaur exhibits. Place really gives you a tropical "blast from a distant past" kinda feel.<br><br>Stop 7 - Pyramid Party!<br><br>The Pyramid's where the Heavy Heart club's at. The entrance is guarded by a few neon Anubises. It's definitely worth a visit if you wanna see where and how business is done in Dogtown. Don't eavesdrop too hard, though; rather, bask in the FEEL of the place.<br>Have a drink, have a dance, have fun! If you're the daring and glib type, maybe you could even get your hands on some stims that haven't even reached NC yet.<br><br>I recommend dousing your hangover in Longshore Stacks - wander among the containers, grab a bite at The Moth, get wasted with the locals again and really get a feel of the place. Soak in the real atmosphere of Dogtown!

Article	Bushidō' and Neopostmodernism	"BUSHIDŌ" AND NEOPOSTMODERNISM<br><br>The "Bushidō" franchise is a litmus test of our time. This groundbreaking film series puts on full display the entire spectrum of American society, masterfully pointing out the greatest problems of the neomodern era. "Live Fast, Die Never" was, in its own way, a generational manifesto on the affirmation of live. The use of vivid colors, shaky cinematography, ubiquitous blood effects and pervasive brain splatter testifies to the extraordinary self-awareness of the director, who once revealed in an interview how he "fucking loves it when hot chicks dissect the shit out of the bad guys." Perhaps no other concept more aptly describes the underlying societal ethos when "Bushidō 3" was released.<br><br>Especially worthy of note is the repetition in subsequent installments of the implant-bomb motif, through the prism of which the protagonist reinterprets reality. One example of this convention's flawless implementation appears in the latest film in the series, "Bushidō X: Fade to Black." The scene in which the powerful Gorira disembodies the arm of Jake - as played by the transcendent Tim Kelly - demonstrates in brilliant form the duality of the human condition. On the one hand, Jake loses his cybernetic arm - a symbol of both his tragic past and the ongoing techno-ontological conflict within his psyche. On the other hand, it is precisely due to this dismemberment that Gorira is blown to bloody bits by a sensational explosion sequence. And the final disintegration of the antagonist's body into a bloodspray of gore, how should this be interpreted? It is a metaphorical cry of deeply rooted despair, a manifestation of the personal transgression. This fragmentation of body could likewise be interpreted as a fragmentation of the individual mind, thus provoking the question: Whose mind? Indeed, had everything the viewer seen of Jake's struggle been, in fact, a personified, embodied fear? Had he not been been[sic] embroiled in epic battle with a vile monster but rather only with himself? Could the entirety of Jake's narrative been only a manifestation of some cyberpsychotic dream-state?<br><br>Among all the depth and nuance that has defined this franchise since its inception, only one thing is truly certain - "Bushidō" has forever changed the world of cinema.			
Article	Caught in the Maelstrom	CAUGHT IN THE MAELSTROM<br><br>I'm stood in the middle of Totentanz, my knuckles white, tightly gripped on Achilles M179e rifle. It was shoved into my hands just seconds before the attack. My face, arms, and syn-leather jacket soaked in the blood and brain matter of the psycho I had just shot. My contact, a thirty-year-old Maelstromer with a green mohawk, patted me on the shoulder.<br><br>"Man, Phil, you ain't half shit" he tells me appreciatively, "Took you for a pussy bitch, but gotta admit you have some steel-clad balls after all. And don't worry about that sad scrapheap. If there ain't at least twenty bodies, you can't call it a Maelstrom party!"<br><br>What had already been an unsettling experience took a turn to a whole other level. The other Maelstromers continued to mock me, but I could detect a tone of approval through all the vocal distortion. My mohawked contact even proposed that they install in me one of their distinct, rudimentary implants. Fortunately, they didn't have in mind their iconic optics suite, so I accepted. My popularity continued to grow.<br><br>"No way you'd get the Maelstrom mug so easy." he laughs, "That tech's only for initiates. We pluck out their eyes and peel back the skin. No anesthetics. You survive, you're in."<br><br>With the atmosphere now more relaxed, I asked if the rumors had been true - do they accept contract killings? My mohawked source nodded with enthusiasm.<br><br>"Oh fuck yeah! We make good scratch and it's a great morale booster. You know, machines ain't bothered with a mess of feelings and that's what we aim for. Doing hitjobs like that helps us gouge out all the gooey emotions we still got left. Recently, this one guy got all whiny and snot-nosed just because we roasted some kid. I told him, I said, 'Dude, you better relive some suppressor BD and fast or bossman's gonna blow your head off!' The gonk should've fucking listened!"<br><br>As I listened to his explanations and anecdotes, I realized that amusement clearly must not be one of their blacklisted emotions.

CYBERWARE CONTROVERSY IN FOOTBALL?<br><br>Never before in a single night has a crowd snapped so abruptly and so frequently between euphoric cheers and deafening silences.<br><br>The most recent match between the NC Corsairs and the San Diego Shredders ended in overwhelming victory for Night City, but it was another team that stole the spotlight. Trauma Team paramedics airlifted out a record seven players during the game due to potentially life-threatening injuries. Three still remain in stable but critical condition.<br><br>This game's unusual spike in injuries was the result of a months-long feud between the two franchises that had hit a boiling point. Shredders head coach Darnell Irving has repeatedly accused the Corsairs of breaking league rules by allowing players to equip military-grade cyberware. Corsairs organization representatives have refuted the allegations, claiming the rules contain no such clear-cut cyberware guidelines. Night City's head coach even went so far as to say that San Diego "would be wise to make the same upgrade instead of crying like babies whenever they get their asses kicked." What he doesn't mention, however, is that the NC Corsairs have a sponsorship deal with NightCorp, granting them exclusive rights to equipment designed in NightCorp's top-secret "Football Science Lab." Salt in the wound...<br><br>Of course, unpersuaded, the San Diego faithful have argued to the league that the use of military-grade technology is damaging to the game's integrity and future. Football analysts and commentators, on the other hand, have dismissed the controversy, saying that the "arms race" mentality has always been pervasive in sports. Their case in point – the 2064 Night City Marathon. In a record-setting and uncontested victory, Austrian runner Dominik Bohm blazed past favorites from the Czech Republic and France because of Vienna's close partnership with Zetatech.			
Article	Dogtown - a splinter in the eye of Night City	DOGTOWN - A SPLINTER IN THE EYE OF NIGHT CITY<br><br>The combat zone known as Dogtown was meant to be Night City's proud calling card. Today, it's but a stain on its conscience, forgotten by NC and its residents, who consider it a monument to grand but futile designs, failed investments and complete loss of control. Dubbed "Serenisands" to convey a sense of tranquil ocean shores, it became everything but – a haven for the excluded, fugitives and common criminals. It was only a matter of time before someone capitalized on this mess and took over the district. That "someone" was, of course, colonel Kurt Hansen and his BARGHEST unit. This is the story of the district's downfall and subsequent rise of Hansen's criminal empire.<br><br>In order to paint the full picture, we have to start at the time of the Fourth Corporate War. Pacifica is being flooded with refugees from Night City proper. They seek shelter on the outskirts of the metropolis, but it quickly becomes clear they aren't welcome there. The constant influx of people creates tension, leading to a conflict with Pacifica's security forces that quickly escalates into full-blown riots. Streets are littered with bodies after violent clashes that often last for days on end. Wealthy locals and investors fear the situation is getting out of hand and decide to leave the district for good, thus expediting its downfall. Pacifica finds itself on a downward spiral and falls into ruin.<br><br>Fast forward to the 2050s. The Night City Council works to restore Pacifica to its former glory. New investors appear, enticing the city officials with bold plans and promises of prosperity. The decade begins with wide-scale construction spearheaded by Militech. Modern buildings replace dilapidated relics of the past and a high-speed road network connects Pacifica to NC and beyond. The investment is meant to be a display of Night City's economic strength, but any such act inevitably breeds resistance. A large explosion under the construction site for the local entertainment complex ruins the buoyant moods of the Night City Council and Pacifica investors. An extensive investigation does not provide any answers and results in doubling the local security detail. More importantly, the council-members decide to build a wall separating Serenisands from the rest of the city. Construction work resumes and for a time, it seems the new measures are enough to bring the investment to completion.<br><br>However, just a few years later, the Unification War breaks out, halting progress once again. Investors back out as completing the construction of a luxury resort drops down the financial priority list. The area, devoid of any law enforcement, becomes a criminal haven controlled by the Voodoo Boys. A lawless, walled-out district neighboring an enemy city seemed like a perfect place for a military assault. Militech also seems to share this view and in 2070, the corporation sends their troops to Serenisands. A full-scale attack on Night City seems to be imminent, but it never happens, in large part thanks to Arasaka's supercarrier, entering Coronado Bay as a result of an agreement signed with Saburo Arasaka by the then-councilman Lucius Rhyne. Militech orders retreat, but a large number of troops decide to ignore the directive and remain in the area.<br><br>The Arvin Accord turns Night City into a fully autonomous metropolis. The abandoned district becomes no-man's land and this is the perfect opportunity for Colonel Kurt Hansen and his ex-Militech unit to take over what is now known as Dogtown. Soon, along with his veteran comrades, he establishes BARGHEST, growing his newly-found army by first recruiting mercenaries and later – all willing renegades and gangoons. The district once again becomes a sanctuary for refugees, fugitives and travellers.<br><br>Today, Dogtown has its own law enforcement and trade relations with Night City, the NUSA and other countries. NC officials are in no hurry to address the issue of the city's noisy neighbors and chances of rebuilding Serenisands in the future are illusory at best. It's much easier to simply look the other way, towards greener pastures. New, exciting opportunities are easier to sell to investors than troublesome combat zones. They'd much rather start from scratch.<br>ep1_generic_cz_history_shard			yes
Article	Dogtown Exposed! The Case of the Hanged Woman	DOGTOWN EXPOSED! THE CASE OF THE HANGED WOMAN<br><br>The body of a young Haitian woman was found near the entrance to the Terra Cognita Technology Park. Her body was strung up by its arms, but not before being completely "fried" and stripped of all cyberware. No faction claimed responsibility thus far. The locals are terrified and nobody seems to be investigating this crime. Nobody except us, that is. Welcome to another edition of "Dogtown Exposed!" where we provide unique insight into local power struggles and keep you updated on what's happening behind the scenes in Pacifica's grittiest sub-district.<br><br>It's no secret that Terra Cognita largely belongs to the Scavs. Add that to the fact all cyberware has been removed from the victim's body and it seems like an open and shut case. However, our Scavenger informant rejects the allegations. "Sure, we all know what it looks like, but... fuck, choom, we're being set up! The day we found the body, we were totally zonked by it. Decided we'll even fuck and take shits with guns in hand, no cap. Someone's clearly after us!"<br><br>Our next step was to reach out to the Voodoo Boys and verify the talk of a possible feud within the gang. They didn't want to talk to us, but they did make an emphatic statement by hacking the computer of one of our reporters and leaving a message, reading: "Didn't do it. EOT." We didn't consider the topic ended, however, and continued our investigation, ultimately reaching a former associate of a high-ranked VDB member. She talked freely and openly about the situation: "Girl wasn't one of us. If she were, we wouldn't hide it. VDBs like theatrics, but we always take responsibility for our actions."<br><br>So then: if neither of the gangs is responsible for the murder, who is? The streets are abuzz with gossip and conspiracy theories. "She was a Scav mole for the VDBs. Or, you know, the other way around," said one Dogtown resident who, fearing retribution, prefers to remain anonymous. "Heard it was a case of forbidden love. A Voodoo Girl fell in love with a Scav... and this is the outcome," claimed one female Dogtown citizen. "Found her first and saw how totally fried she was. Positive she was a mule, a virus carrier, you know? Her goal was to infect everyone in Terra Cognita, but her ICE got all fucked and she self-fried. Good riddance if you ask me! Live by the sword, die by the sword and all that," said an older citizen who approached us while we were conducting our enquiries[sic]. But who hung her over the gate if that's what happened? "Oh, fuck off, you journo hacks! Nitpicking whenever someone says something smart!"<br><br>We kept digging, looking for answers and checking with all our sources, to no avail. But just when we were ready to give up, someone sent us CCTV footage from the BARGHEST vehicle control outpost by the gate.<br><br>What we saw there was puzzling to say the least. A woman exits the car. Video quality is too low to determine her identity with 100% accuracy, but she definitely resembles the murdered Haitian. Suddenly, the woman starts twitching and convulsing, but nobody cares enough to help her. The woman falls on the ground and finally goes limp. One of the guards lights a cigarette and continues his conversation with his colleague. Finally, the smoking guard gets in the woman's car and drives away from the station. The other guard drags the body into the darkness and out of the shot...<br><br>What has transpired on that fateful night at the Dogtown border? It is possible we will never know. BARGHEST remains silent on the matter and any witnesses other than the brave soul who has sent us the video (and never contacted us again) refuse to come forward.<br><br>That doesn't mean we are willing to abandon our investigation. Is it possible that Kurt Hansen's men are trying to escalate the conflict between the Scavs and the Voodoo Boys? If that's the case, what is their ultimate goal in doing so? Be sure to read the next edition of "Dogtown Exposed!" where we may provide new information on the matter.<br>ep1_generic_cz_article_shard			yes
Article	EBM Petrochem Stadium, Night City	EBM PETROCHEM STADIUM, NIGHT CITY<br><br>Though already analyzed at length in its implementation of brutalist aesthetic design (see: "Light/weight", M. Linden), not enough discussion has revolved around the stadium's likewise "brutalist" security system. The use of technology common to the prison industrial complex in the facility's security measures is an open, though largely ignored, secret. In particular, the architects placed special emphasis on crowd control and riot de-escalation. The stadium's sections are divided by blast doors, which are kept open during events, but lowered during riots to quickly isolate small groups for easier pacification. However, in a controversial move, the designers granted full authority of all security measures to the system's resident AI.<br><br>What does AI-regulated crowd control mean for judgment calls? Can it distinguish cyberpsychotic violence from that of self defense? Will people fleeing a riot be permitted to leave, or trapped inside with the firestarters? Considering the literal fortunes spent on the stadium's construction and technological development therein, most experts do not anticipate any sort of critical system failure that could lead to disaster of that scale. Still, it appears rather obvious that this mega-monument to Nighthawks football was built not with the fans and players at heart, but the corporate stakeholders who financed it. They've long known how to entertain the masses; now, they know how to subjugate them.<br>q304_stadium_architects_look			yes
Article	Emergency on Demand	EMERGENCY ON DEMAND<br><br>How did it happen? When and why did we as a society decide that human life is a commodity? A luxury?<br><br>My mother passed away at 45. She still had decades of life to live until it was all stolen from her by common pneumonia. If she had held even the cheapest Trauma Team policy, she could have been cured within an hour. But she couldn't afford it. My mother died five months before her scheduled appointment with our family practitioner...<br><br>The idea of privatized healthcare is deeply ingrained in our public psyche. Already in 2020, there was widespread consensus that 500 eurodollars a month was a fair price for Trauma Team insurance. Health wasn't something you were given, it was something you earned. The private system may not be perfect, but there's no alternative, we thought.<br><br>BULLSHIT.<br><br>Now cross the Pacific Ocean to the USSR where they also have highly trained medical technicians, high-precision nanosurgical suites, specialized antibodies, intravenous probes, the list goes on. Emergency airlifts using modern AVs equipped with cryotonic chambers? They have those, too. The difference, then? They don't leave their people to die on the streets, at the store, in their homes. They don't force anyone to purchase their lives from a corporation as if they're the ones who own it.<br><br>Public healthcare isn't some unachievable utopia. It is a REALITY.<br><br>Trauma Team, on the other hand, treats its policyholders as both potential patients to be treated and potential products to be bought. They save lives only because there is profit in it. A saved life is a returning customer. Client death can also bring in fiscal gains in the form of organ and implant resale, though of course in regulated, smaller sums. An emergency care provider can't afford to give its managers reasons to deliberately kill off its clientele base for short-term windfalls.<br><br>Surely, you ask, these medical "professionals" are also guided by their Hippocratic Oaths?<br><br>Please...			
Article	Extraterrestrial ménage à trois	EXTRATERRESTRIAL MÉNAGE À TROIS<br><br>According to international law, space belongs to everybody – yes, yourself included. In practice however, it is controlled by three major players: Orbital Air, the European Space Council and the Highriders. The Keynan[sic] megacorporation has completely monopolized the market of commercial space travel and the ESC is focused on scientific exploration – for the good of all mankind, allegedly. And the Highriders? They're simply... home. They live among the stars and aren't particularly keen to welcome visitors, especially those who insist they should leave.<br><br>The tensions in relations between space nomads and the ESC are the result of a decades-old tussle over political and economical control of Luna and independent orbital stations. How does Orbital Air fit into this conflict, then? Interestingly enough, they didn't take sides. While the corporate Goliath would be able to wipe the renegades using a fraction of its military power, it opts to stay neutral and often offers to mediate between the Highriders and the ESC. We can only theorize why that is, but swiping the issue with Occam's razor points us to the conclusion it's probably all about the money. Waging war against the native spacers (as they like to think of themselves) would bring them little to no financial benefits while the PR damage could be disastrous, seeing as many of the Highriders emigrated from Africa and – obviously – Kenya. Even if they're not allying themselves with the spacers outright, simply abiding them can be hugely beneficial to Orbital Air, especially long-term, since – just like space – a corporation's outlook seems to be infinite.<br>ep1_generic_orbital_air_business_shard

"It didn't happen all of a sudden," says Stephenson, when asked about the circumstances surrounding his conversion. "I had a lot of time to think about what I did. After a while I understood that what I wanted more than anything was forgiveness," added the convict.<br><br>Joshua Stephenson is serving a sentence for aggravated assault and murder. He showed no remorse during his sentencing, so it is difficult to take his conversion at face-value. Perhaps it has something to do with the enormous media buzz his baptism has created.

Scandals involving city EMTs colluding with scavengers have gone from rare to commonplace.<br><br>Recent cuts in municipal healthcare spending have led to the outright collapse of a medical system that already underperformed by most standards in the developed world.

Article	Net Shamans	NET SHAMANS<br><br>Pacifica has everything you would expect of a place with such an infamous reputation. Shady locals, sketchy shops... and the presence of the enigmatic Voodoo Boys. Enigmatic how, you ask? After all, it is not uncommon for close-knit gangs to harbor secrets about which the rest of the city is completely unaware. And the Voodoo Boys are no different from any of those groups... Right?<br><br>Now ask yourself this: Have you ever witnessed a gang shootout? Probably more times than you can caount on two hands. And who was there? The Valentinos, Tyger Claws, Maelstrom, 6th Street... but never the Voodoo Boys. Never them.<br><br>Depending on who you ask, you will hear different stories and opinions about this reclusive gang. They are the de facto leaders of Night City's Haitian diaspora. They slaughter black roosters in blood sacrifice (God only knows where they get them). They commune with their ancestors through prayer. They summon ghosts and allow them to assume control of their bodies. They bring pain, disease and suffering to their enemies' doorstep with the help of occult voodoo dolls. Perhaps, you think, some or even all of these claims are just hollow rumors... but can you be so sure?<br><br>Some say they have witnessed Voodoo Boys netrunners in the Deep Net. Surrounded by Vampires and Leviathans, they traverse these strange depths of cyberspace, both more beautiful and dangerous than we could ever imagine in realspace - their objectives there known only to themselves...<br><br>So, who are they? What are they searching for? What is their plan? In the end, perhaps we shouldn't ask ourselves these questions. Indeed, some secrets are better left undiscovered.			
Article	New business trends in sports	NEW BUSINESS TRENDS IN SPORTS<br><br>(...) we are left with the following question: is the essence of sports changing? Yes, it's still about breaking records and searching for the limits of human ability (although we've already pushed these limits hard with the aid of technology). However, can we still call sport a competition? Here we especially need to consider an increasingly popular trend: "building" athletes from childhood.<br>Of course, there has long been a technological race in sports; in this aspect it is an industry like any other. There is also a long tradition of huge investments in both teams and individual athletes, as well as in events and tournaments. However, it's one thing to pack chrome into young, yet already grown people, based on their talents developed in a particular direction, and another to burden the bodies of children as young as nine with multiple implants!<br><br> In such extreme cases, I guess it's hard to even call it a competition anymore, other than that between technology companies fighting amongst themselves for the most optimal test yard. Young people seem to be treated more like implant carriers, destined for a specific sport, rather than talents whose performance can be turned up a notch with these implants.<br><br>Burdened by these thoughts, I can't get two very important questions out of my head: is there still a place for competition and excitement in sports? And what do genuine enthusiasts get out of sports these days?<br>ep1_generic_future_sport_shard			
Article	New Release Braindances	NEW RELEASE BRAINDANCES<br><br>What's up, BD-maniacs? Hungry for a new emo-rush? Then check out the latest word from the freshest BDs on the market.<br><br>Foreign Body<br><br>The body is everything. There is nothing else. It is you, but it is also just a tool for your mind to interact with the world. But what would happen if this tool tried to live its own life? What if it tried... to kill you?<br><br>Though not a particularly original addition to the thriller genre, this braindance featuring Luke Poller is still a solid experiential ride. The fear of disobedient implants has been around since pirates were walking around on peg legs – well, maybe not that long – as a result, the trope has been pervasive in film, braindance, and urban legend alike. Still, "Foreign Body" borrows some of the genre's best elements while still incorporating just enough new stuff to the mix to keep it interesting. After all, it's not every day you see the world from the perspective of a sentient arm.<br><br>Maxwell's Rehab<br><br>This braindance season has been chock full of horror, but this one stands out from the rest. The always phenomenal Maxwell Ramirez is pushed to the brink of cyberpsychosis so we can relive his return to normalcy. The title offers a tone of optimism, but don't let that fool you. You will relive Maxwell's slip into psychosis, the heartbreak of his wife, and the gradual reintegration into a world that is now far different from how he left it. This BD is a must-relive of the season, but it's not for the faint of heart.<br><br>Badlands Raid<br><br>At last, a BD for those looking for something a little lighter. "Badlands Raid" is a remake of the 2023 classic, which was an innovative tour de force of the time. For those of you unfamiliar, the plot revolves around an ordinary, boring guy who accidentally gets tangled up in a nomad ambush on a Zetatech convoy. I won't spoil it because, even though the main plot hasn't changed in 54 years, most people these days probably don't know the ending. What I will say is this: the remake's creators have introduced a few modern twists into the story that should make for a pleasant surprise to classics-lovers and newbies alike.<br>generic_latest_braindances_shard			yes
Article	News report 07/17/2062	NEWS REPORT 07/17/2062<br><br>A fatal incident occurred on Friday in Laguna Bend, a town located in the area surrounding Night City. Residents refused to vacate their homes - properties which had been officially declared a construction zone by the corporation which had purchased the land. Despite not all homes having been evacuated, construction workers were ordered to begin their work to prevent further financial losses due to delays. One resident climbed a crane in order to stall construction. The crane operator responded by lobbing objects found in his control room at the man. The operator subsequently lost control of the suspended load, which collided into a home and killed a family who were still inside.<br><br>The conflict between NC Dam Ltd. and the residents is not new, but until now has not lead to any casualties.<br><br>The dispute began a few months ago when rent prices in Laguna Bend rose drastically, after which residents were informed that the land on which their houses stood was to become a reservoir. Some of the residents relocated to temporary housing that was built as compensation. However, those who ignored municipal directives and stayed put became the victims of a corporate smear campaign which identified them as "agents of public unrest" (APUs) who were preventing necessary construction in order to secure access to clean water for all of Night City.<br><br>As a result, public opinion quickly turned against residents of Laguna Bend and few, if any, paid attention to the change in police tactics and open violence against the residents. One could say it was only a matter of time before incidents like the one on Friday would occur.			
Article	Night City football teams	NIGHT CITY FOOTBALL TEAMS<br><br>Fans of professional sports often say that Night City is the only large metropolis in America without a football team, even though a single glance at the football league standings is enough to notice the undeniable success of the Night City Corsairs. This state of affairs can cause confusion among those new to the sport, but the truth is, local football fans simply do not consider the Corsairs their own, despite the team's name and official affiliation. Here's the short story of football teams in our city.<br><br>Night City Rangers, the city's beloved original franchise, was one of the many victims of the turmoil that shook the metropolis in the 2020s. NC remained without a team for a number of years before a group of investors, wanting to turn Pacifica into a luxury vacation resort, decided to establish a new super-team dubbed the Night City Nighthawks.<br><br>Marquee players, wealthy sponsors providing access to state-of-the-art athletic cyberware and most of all, EBM Petrochem Stadium – a modern venue designed to become the icon of Pacifica's new identity.<br><br>If all of this sounds too good to be true, it's because it ultimately was. The grandiose plans of the investors came crashing down in spectacular fashion, and the Nighthawks were disbanded a mere handful of games.<br><br>This failure did not kill the city's desire to have a team, but this time, NC officials decided on a different approach – if you can't create a franchise, buy an existing one. Tempted by the promise of unprecedented tax exemptions, the owners of the Sacramento Corsairs agreed to relocate the team to Night City. However, the switch only happened on paper. Because EBM Petrochem Stadium became a black market and gang haven of Dogtown—Pacifica's autonomous region—the Corsairs still play their games in Sacramento. No surprise, then, that NC residents do not think of the franchise as their team.<br><br>Will there ever come a time when Night City will have a true hometown football team with its own venue? In speeches, Jefferson Peralez has mentioned establishing an entirely new franchise, but most media consider this nothing more than mere campaign rhetoric to boost ratings.<br><br>Will Night City residents ever again get to fill the seats of a stadium, buying foam fingers and beer, to cheer on a football team they can truly call their own?

Article	Nomads at Ground Zero	NOMADS AT GROUND ZERO<br><br>(...) It was no secret Night Corp offered generous pay and, in some cases, free cyberware and biomonitor upgrades to anyone willing to help clean up the crater of radioactive rubble at AHQ ground zero. Some firsthand accounts recall the incessant ticking of Geiger counters, like the loud buzz of cicadas in summer. In retrospect, we can only guess how many "crater cleaners" lost their lives to radiation sickness shortly thereafter. Both the city government and Night Corp have claimed casualties were kept to a minimum, while providing no official statistics to substantiate the claim. That being said, they have never been under pressure to release such figures. After all, most rescue, engineering, and rubble cleanup teams were not local Night Citizens, but nomads. Surprised you didn't know? Don't be. It is a fact many history courses tend to overlook.<br><br>The city employed hundreds of nomad mercenaries, primarily from clans in Aldecaldo nation. These nomads were hungry for gainful work and the city needed experts who were not only experienced but brave enough to knowingly put their lives on the line - all so Arasaka could one day erect another tower in its place. But history is not without its sense of irony. These nomads, who so deliberately live outside our so-called "system," came to its very rescue. Not for the first time. And not for the last.

This useful little guide you're holding contains essential information on the Night City's largest gangs where you'll learn:<br><br>*Which districts to avoid<br><br>*How to recognize gang members<br><br>*How to avoid dangerous situations<br><br><br>Animals: The Animals aren't real animals - they're freaks of nature! Pumped to the gills with strength-enhancing hormones, they look more like piles of meat than people. They generally avoid cyberware with the exception of cosmetic modifications that supposedly make them look more like, well, animals. They're extremely aggressive and don't need an excuse to start a brawl. But despite their name, the Animals are not a territorial gang - you can find fierce, hostile packs of them throughout the city.<br><br>6th Street Gang: From a distance they could be easily mistaken for soldiers on leave - military uniforms, combat boots, buzz cuts, shouting "Oorah!" every chance they get. But don't let appearances fool you! These are violent, dangerous thugs, ready to slit your throat without the slightest hesitation. You'll want to watch out for them especially in Vista Del Rey.<br><br>The Mox: Handsome girls, beautiful guys... but wait, it's a trap! They'll reel you in with their charm, and when you're least expecting it... BAM! Your eddies're gone. Or worse. The hole-in-a-wall that passes for their headquarters is called "Lizzie's Bar" - best seen from far away and never entered.<br><br>Maelstrom: If you ever find yourselves in Watson's industrial area (and it's better that you don't), watch out for the sinister faceplates - that's Maelstrom. To be a part of the gang, you have to get your eyes and nose cut off and replaced with demonic, fiery-red optics. Ouch! If they do that to themselves, who knows what they'll do to strangers?! Better to leave that mystery unsolved.<br><br>Tyger Claws: Effervescent neon tattoos with Asian motifs? Katanas and shurikens? Racing bikes? These are some of the trademarks of the Tyger Claws gang, with a noticeable presence in Japantown. Ignore them and they shouldn't bother you... but do something to provoke them and it's sayonara, baby!<br><br>Valentinos: Golden grills, golden implants, golden crosses and golden machetes? Say ¡Hola! to the Valentinos. Despite the Catholic symbolism, they're not exactly "Love thy neighbor" types. Those who get in their way usually end up copped into pieces and tossed into the Del Coronado.<br><br>Voodoo Boys: These predominantly Haitian gangers are based in Pacifica, but they hunt their victims elsewhere - the Net. The Voodoo Boys are the most skilled netrunners in the Night City underworld. But beware! That doesn't mean they're not dangerous in realspace too! Be sure to give them a wide berth, or you might just end up like on of their black roosters - without a head.			
Article	Samurai' Thirty Years Later: Facts, Myths, and More Myths	"SAMURAI" THIRTY YEARS LATER: FACTS, MYTHS, AND MORE MYTHS<br><br>When Silverhand formed Samurai, he did so as a fully-fledged artist. He knew what he wanted, and as the group's charismatic leader, he knew how to impose his vision on the rest of the band.<br><br>The roles in the group were clearly divided. Johnny and Kerry Eurodyne were the inspired provocateurs, the continually conflicted soul of the band. Meanwhile, Henry (bass) lived in his own world, even in those rare instances when he wasn't high out of his mind. He may never have known how good he was. Rumor had it Silverhand was sleeping with Henry to keep him in the band. Silverhand was also rumored to be sleeping with Kerry to boost the latter's morale. The truth is, Johnny was sleeping with everyone, though his heart wasn't always in it.<br><br>Soon after Samurai's breakup, Henry suffered a literal shock in an accident, after which he began behaving even more strangely than usual. And then, almost as if he'd been steady and waiting to jump at the chance, he hit rock bottom.<br><br>Nancy (keyboards) was the single reasonable, normal person in the group - she came to a gig, played to the best of her ability, then went home. Only thing was, her toxic, aggressive piece-of-shit husband was at home, too. He ended up tightening his grip on her enough that she left the band. Soon after, he tried to turn the screw some more, but something in Nancy snapped. She finally remembered her murky gang past, and her husband had more than enough to think about as he fell eighty floors down. After seven months spent in jail, Nancy returned to Samurai, but it wasn't the same. In the end, she left again for good and started a new media career as Bes Isis for N54 News.<br><br>Denny, drummer and high-functioning neurotic plagued by thousands of real and imagined obsessions, was only truly herself on stage. Off stage, she spent most of her time trying to prove to herself she wasn't as fucked up as everybody seemed to think.<br><br>That's likely why she took up with Henry - compared to him, Denny was normal indeed.<br><br>If it hadn't been for Silverhand's legendary hatred of managers, those slick ass-kissers who told you what to say and when, when and where you were going to play and who you have to play nice with, Samurai could have achieved much greater success. Instead, they always remained a punk alternative, icons of cool and uncompromising rebellion.<br><br>One day, you can't get into one of their gigs, the next you could walk right by a whacked-out Silverhand puking into the river. And that's what Johnny would call true freedom, before barfing on your shoes.<br><br>Silverhand's death was what truly launched Samurai into the realm of legend - and out of reality.

Article	Slavoj McAllister in the News Again	SLAVOJ MCALLISTER IN THE NEWS AGAIN<br><br>Pompous asshole or eccentric genius? Acclaimed rockerboy Slavoj McAllister has ruffled feathers yet again following his most recent performance at nightclub Totentanz. While a rock concert brawl is no big news in itself, several unofficial sources allege it was McAllister who instigated the violent outbreak after hurling a tear gas canister at paparazzi in the crowd. Before the booze-fueled melee got heated, the Cartesian Duelists premiered new songs "Cybernetic Soul," "Mind Is Freedom," and "Cogito Ergo Sum,"[1] which, as usual, have critics divided. Lyrically, the new singles touch on issues such as the internal struggle of body and mind, the limitations of our senses, and the search for absolute truths. Some critics consider the new material pseudointellectual drivel - others praise the band's fresh, innovative spin on the genre.<br><br>Beyond the brawl, even the McAllister's headlines are making headlines. When asked in an interview with N54 News what the cryptic title of the track "Cogito Ergo Sum" meant, the rockerboy replied he "ain't revved by questions from gonkbrained frauds... What are you?"<br><br>Despite (or perhaps thanks to?) the numerous controversies ever swirling around the Cartesian Duelists frontman, his popularity continues to swell. The band's new album is slated for release soon and, if you believe the chatter on the Net, it will be entitled "War of Truths."

Article	The Last Rockerboy: The Solo Career of Kerry Eurodyne	THE LAST ROCKERBOY: THE SOLO CAREER OF KERRY EURODYNE<br><br>The friendship between Johnny Silverhand and Kerry Eurodyne as well as the trauma behind Johnny's mysterious disappearance have contributed to the cloak of misinformation that has obscured the true story of Samurai for years. The stubbornly loyal Eurodyne always kept silent about the foundational leadership role he held in the cult band. To the detriment of his own career, he paid full tribute to Silverhand, granting him full authorship over the band's songs.<br><br>Following Samurai's disintegration and a personal retreat to the Philippines where Kerry rediscovered his creative roots, Eurodyne cut ties from the past and began the next chapter of his legacy. Today, it has become clear beyond doubt that his own successes not only match those of Samurai's, but have repeatedly surpassed them. Kerry's effortless, natural charisma and strong stage presence electrify crowds without fail. By comparison, Silverhand's fiery shouts and political grandstanding appear now as nothing more than ordinary attention grabbing designed to mask the otherwise pedestrian quality of his musical talent.			
Article	The Long Return: Aftermath of the Great Nomad Tragedy	THE LONG RETURN: AFTERMATH OF THE GREAT NOMAD TRAGEDY<br><br>(...) Most sources indicate that the governments of Peru, Brazil and Chile have come to a solution for the so-called "Nomad Problem." In an attempt to prevent the illegal, transnational movement and (typically temporary) settlement of nomad clans across the South American continent, they plan to seal all borders to "undocumented persons of dubious origin." Protestations from scholars, human rights groups and even corporate representatives have thus far been ignored. Some corporations have voiced concerns that stifling the flow of migrant work could lead to economic decline and unpredictable social unrest. For example, some experts predict the local Brazilian workforce will simply be too small to meet the employment demands of ongoing major agrocorp ventures.<br><br>This push for tightened anti-nomad immigration policies comes as yet another heavy blow from South American governments against an already heavily targeted demographic. More information continues to surface about the so-called Long Return, where hundreds of thousands of nomads lost their jobs without warning and had their equipment (much of it personal, not company, property) illegally seized by government authorities. Most laborers were relocated from North America specifically for this work and, without corporate support, were forced to vacate the hazardous area formerly home to the Amazon rainforest in a week's time. With their only lifeline suddenly severed and no legal basis for staying, many dozens of thousands attempted to find a way home, even if that mean walking much of that distance.<br><br>Initial reports show staggering figures for the number who died during this mass exodus. Many still ask "Why?" Who benefits from these anti-nomad policies and border closures if not the South American nations or corporations? Many speculate that lobbyists from Orbital Air and other lunar colony representatives played a key part. Their objective, some allege, is to limit opportunities for migrant contract work so more will be forced for the sake of survival to accept employment in the notoriously difficult labor conditions of low Earth orbit and on the Moon.			
Article	The Mox	THE MOX<br><br>(...)It's one of those stories that is either very simple or very complicated, depending on who you ask. For Janice, it was a mix of both: "The Mox came to exist because it had to. We didn't have a soul in our corner, no one to make sure street justice was on our side. So we took matters into our own hands."<br><br>The Mox is composed of the people who, if any of them disappeared from the streets tomorrow, you might never even notice: sex workers, ennyless artists, aimless rebels, and restless souls who weren't dealt a fair hand. Today, the Mox is thriving, as demonstrated by the booming biz of Lizzie's Bar. Lizzie's is renown for being arguably the best braindance club in Night City. Corporate suits, gangoons, pop stars, and locals alike all gather at Lizzie's to kick back, have a drink, and dip into the most beautifully scrolled and tuned BDs you've ever experienced. Most customers, however, are oblivious to the fact that the club is gang owned and operated, that the Mox are in charge, watching after their own. Just like the Lizzie of legend once did.<br><br>Know the story? "Lizzied used to work here back when it was just a typical dive with a stripper pole," Janice proudly explained. "She took care of the girls, made sure eddies were falling into the pockets... and their teeth weren't falling to the curb. Like this one time, this fucker (Editor's note: referring to a Tyger Claws gang member) was having too much "fun" with one of the girls, and Lizzie just couldn't stomach it anymore. Story is she deprived the worm of his little Tyger balls so quick and nasty it took them two days to clean up all the blood and puke splatter. 'Course, the Claws found out fast and they flatlined her in a flash. But everyone that she had impacted in some way, they were still around.

Article	The Patriots of 6th Street	THE PATRIOTS OF 6TH STREET<br><br>When I think about the best the New United States has to offer, it's the men and women of 6th Street who I see in my mind's eye. All Night Citizens recognize the name, but it is the residents of Vista del Rey who owe a lot to 6th Street... A lot, if not everything. There was a time when entrepreneurs of all varieties tried their luck in the neighborhood, but most wound up ennyless and hungry. Cab drivers, mechanics, shopkeepers... Small businesses fell right and left in the total economic devastation that arrived in the wake of the Fourth Corporate War. As larger corporations like Arasaka expanded their business into the area, local franchises saw their customer pool dry up. Nascent gangs seized control of the streets, terrorizing residents on such a scale that even police intervention proved a useless endeavor.<br><br>But then they began to appear - professional soldiers returning home to Vista from tours of duty. Though they expected to return to the sound of children's laughter in the streets and the sumptuous smell of freshly grilled scopburgers, they were instead shocked and disheartened by the chaos and destruction that greeted them. And yet, their will could not be broken. Like true-blooded Americans they took matters into their own hands. They stockpiled Militech weaponry, trained their neighbors as they had been trained, and exacted their revenge on the scattered, brutal gangs that savaged their home.<br><br>So formed the 6th Street paramilitary company. Whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans together in arms patrolling the streets of Night City together - a unified force demonstrating what it means to be a patriot. Their enemies spread baseless slander of theft and smuggling. But they are resilient in both constitution and belief - proud, young, and eager for a future when the states once again stand united. They await the day someone will bring America from its knees just as they have done with Vista del Rey.			
Article	The Relic - why all the fuss?	THE RELIC - WHY ALL THE FUSS?<br><br>For years, experts in the field of cybernetics, neurology and psychology have been desperately trying to merge human consciousness with silicon. Until now, their efforts have been unsuccessful - though scientists have managed to create artificial intelligences that can compare, or indeed, surpass human intellect, copying the human "I" has remained beyond our capabilities. Attempts to do so have merely resulted in sophisticated chatbots - digital beings capable of mimicking human speech and mannerisms, but devoid of self-awareness.<br><br>Today, experts from Arasaka announced a breakthrough. Their newest project, dubbed the "Relic," allows human minds to be copied onto shards no larger than a credchip.<br><br>What's more, the shard can be slotted into one's neural port, allowing its user to "hear" and "see" digitized personality constructs.<br><br>Sadly, I haven't been able to personally examine the specifications of this remarkable piece of technology. Access to the Relic is heavily restricted by Arasaka, and only a small, select group of testers are allowed to participate in the program. Unsurprisingly, these testers are among the wealthiest and most influential people in the world - precisely the kinds of people Arasaka would like to have in its pocket.

Article	The Struggle of O'Neill Station.	THE STRUGGLE OF O'NEILL STATION.<br><br>The European Space Agency (ESA) started out with seemingly noble intentions: "We'll open the door to the universe." "The Solar System - a home to all." And so on an so forth.<br><br>It didn't take long for these catchphrases to reveal themselves for what they truly were - colonial ambitions wrapped up in lofty ideals. We, the builders and first inhabitants of O'Neill 1 have witnessed this first-hand. The ESA sent us into space with promises of a new life and a better tomorrow. Instead, what lay in wait for us was a complete lack of freedom and back-breaking work in extremely dangerous conditions.<br><br>We would've pulled through, we would've toughed it out for the greater good - if only they treated us as human beings, informed us of their decisions, listened to our concerns and requests... But the ESA ignored us.<br><br>The consequences were inevitable - in 2022, after completing construction of the station, our situation was critical. Station management demanded eighteen hours of work every day, seven days a week from everyone - regardless of age or health condition. Our peaceful protest was met with a disproportionate use of force, which included stun-guns. They thought it would break us, just like the countless protests they broke back on Earth.<br><br>The thing is, out here it's not so easy to call for reinforcements. Workers outnumbered guards 40:1, and one stun-gun charge held only fifteen rounds. The ESA's management had effectively shot themselves in the foot. It was over before they could realize - only seven hours passed before O'Neill 1 and O'Neill 2 declared independence and became the first nations established outside of Earth...			
Article	The Valar Mission, Back To Square One	THE VALAR MISSION, BACK TO SQUARE ONE<br><br>The failure of the Valar mission – which undermines the progress of the Lieserl 3.0 program and our understanding of exoplanet group 9726-O9 – may be definitive proof that the current space race is hindering overall space exploration efforts rather than fueling them through "noble competition."<br><br>In 2060, Lagaretta predicted that the pace of technological development at the time would lead to the confirmation of the existence of white holes and the discovery of a theory for quantum gravity within fifteen years. Alas, those fifteen years have come and gone. Perhaps if the ESA, SRC, and Orbital Air tried to cooperate and share information in the spirit of science for a change rather than torpedoing each other's research, the situation today might be very different.<br><br>I do not claim to be a visionary as Lagaretta was, but I would bet my last eurodollar that the next major mission success will launch from O'Neill 1 – not Earth.<br>generic_space_exploration_shard

Article	The Voodoo Boys: What We Know and What We Don't	THE VOODOO BOYS: WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE DON'T<br><br>[...]It comes as no great surprise that the Haitians of Night City consider Pacifica their territory; after all, they built it with their hands, blood and sweat. In the 2060s, corporations employed members of the Haitian diaspora as cheap labor to construct their hotels, amusement park rides, swimming pools and the various other attractions and luxuries that would establish Pacifica as the city's premier entertainment district.<br><br>2069 marks the year Haitians recognized Pacifica as their new home. The Unification War scared off the investors who had been pumping money into the up-and-coming district, leaving their contract laborers without work, a safety net and any hope for a bright future. In a sense, the Haitian community had already endured such abandonment before, when the island nation had been devastated beyond livable means by natural disasters and none heeded their call for humanitarian aid. Pacifica has since become their island reborn: self-sufficient and cut off from the rest of the city.<br><br>[...]So little is known about the Voodoo Boys that the few shreds of information we do have are typically void of context and, more often than not, become the seeds of myth and factual distortion. Indeed, one such example is the widely held belief that the Voodoo Boys gang formed only after the Haitian diaspora transplanted itself into Night City; however, nothing could prove farther from the truth. The gang had existed in some form well before the catastrophe of 2062, though of course under a different name (hereafter, both the Night City and Haitian groups are referred to as the Voodoo Boys for the sake of clarity). Similarly, they performed a different role than they do now in Night City. In Haiti, the Voodoo Boys acted solely as a cadre of netrunners; whereas in Night City, they also fulfill a social function. In the city's Pacifica district, they establish the common law and likewise enforce it, ensuring the relative well-being of their fellow residents. The loyalty they hold for "their own" is as steadfast as their contempt for all those "from the city."			
Article	The Wall	THE WALL<br><br>(...) Why does a wall separate South California from its northern sibling? NUSA officials will tell you it's about ensuring freedom and safety. After all, the first things that come to people's minds when they hear "North California" are shifty nomad families, illegal immigrants and violent criminals of every stripe. They'll say the Wall is necessary for customs officers to prevent smuggling - and we're not just talking drugs. Markets on the rise for trafficking include illegal cyberware (assembled in old hangars), biotech equipment and precious items from orbital stations and lunar colonies.<br><br>And I understand that. I can even understand that when you cross the border, you willingly waive your right to privacy, from having your face scanned and registered to your car being tracked with heavily armed drones that transmit your real-time coordinates to a rapid-response defense system in orbit - all on the off-chance you're in fact a terrorist. For the split-second that you go through the security gates, Militech (or whoever won the bid to secure the Wall) won't allow you to forget that you're in a potential warzone. And that's exactly what the Wall is - a REMINDER. A reminder of how fragile peace and the independence of our city is. As a Night Citizen, I see the Wall relatively frequently. Thanks to that concrete monstrosity (there's really no other way to describe it) I always bear the cost of peace in mind. Is that good? Bad? You decide for yourselves.	Rampakslue	the_wall

Article	Tinnitus - Music(?) Review - An Attempt	TINNITUS - MUSIC(?) REVIEW - AN ATTEMPT<br><br>Right... so I've never had a problem like this before. I learned members of the Maelstrom gang perceive the "music" from their fave band Tinnitus differently than the average listener. Those crazy uber-chromed motherfuckers describe these "tunes" with terms like "complexity," "range," and "depth of sound."... ahem... Those aren't QUITE the words I would use. Music can contain noise but, in this case, the noise does not contain music. I dunno... that's the best I can describe it.<br><br>Now I've got two leading theories on this: <br><br>Theory #1: Since Tinnitus only plays at the Totentanz, the acoustics could be the cause.<br><br>Problem: Maelstrom's a group of hyperviolent psychoscumbags. I'm not gonna rust my good rep by jammin out at one of their live shows. How can I confirm my theory if I don't go check it out firsthand? <br><br>Theory #2: Hallucintory[sic] agents. Maybe Tinnitus has its own homebrew chemical cocktail designed to pair with their music for some whole... "experience." <br><br>To be honest, I don't think I want to know. Because if #2 is true then I'll be risking a drug-induced nervous sys meltdown for the sake of music science journalism. That really worth it, chooms? <br><br>Jesus guys, music doesn't need to be this complicated...			
Article	Tourism advisory: Stay within city limits!	TOURISM ADVISORY: STAY WITHIN CITY LIMITS!<br><br>(...)STICK TO CITY CENTER FOR SAFETY. Unfortunately, the areas surrounding Night City still pose significant risks to travelers. The city stands on the disputed border between North and South California. The echoed crack of gunfire can be heard coming from this political fault line day and night. Although border patrols bravely and tirelessly pursue illegal migrant caravans and hunt down merciless bands of nomads who prey on innocent civilians, much of the surrounding area can nevertheless prove dangerous. To ensure your safety, several corporations have dedicated their resources to defend city borders. Border checkpoints require a special pass, and any attempt to cross without one requires security forces to open fire without hesitation. Stay on the right side of the law to avoid any unfortunate accidents.<br><br>SAFE SKIES OVER NIGHT CITY. Ground transportation into the city is only advised if you are accompanied by corporate or military personnel. Instead, visitors to Night City are strongly encouraged to travel by plane. Daily connections from major American cities and orbit are available. The spaceport is located on Morro Rock, just off the coast, and is accessible from the ring road by exiting onto Spaceport Blvd. The island has some of the best views of the city, so we recommend a pitstop to snap a few still even if you have no plans to fly!			
Article	Truth hidden in plain sight	TRUTH HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT<br><br>(...) we're like animals that have enough self-awareness to realize they're living on a farm, their freedom limited, their death inevitable, yet believing they understand the inner machinations of their small, isolated world. Imperfect, but familiar.<br><br>The truth, as always, eludes us. Those in control try desperately to hide the fact that the truth cannot be found within the confines of the farm, but beyond it - below it. This dangerous, grim truth. The ones who watch us, control us, rule over us, steer us into our pens so cunningly we are not even aware of it. They offer scandals and outrageous conspiracy theories to excite us, mislead us and deceive us into believing that we are capable of peeking behind the curtain. They do this to inflate our egos and make us feel smart. This is no better illusion than overconfidence. They've conditioned us to look only where and when they want us to. The true nightmares... these can only be found on the periphery of our perception.<br><br>Whole universes are being created in cyberspace, designed by powerful AIs at the behest of their corporate overlords. But what is their goal? Who or what is their target? What role does the Blackwall play in all this?

Article	What happened to the passengers of flight OA 1222?	WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PASSENGERS OF FLIGHT OA 1222?<br><br>The tragic fate of passengers aboard flight OA 1222 from Night City to Guangzhou, China is a mystery that has quickly become imaginative fuel for conspiracy theorists.<br><br>To recap: contact with the eighty-four men who boarded the OA TerraLines aircraft on the day of the NCX massacre was lost shortly after landing at their destination. It has been established that all of the missing passengers successfully went through passport control upon their arrival - there is therefore no doubt that they arrived at their destination safe and sound. Surveillance cameras last saw the men entering a bus in the parking lot of the spaceport. What became of them after is an ongoing mystery.<br><br>According to testimony from the families of the missing passengers, the men were to be employed by a "reputable Asian construction firm" that was reportedly seeking workers to help build a new metropolis. However, the NCPD's investigation has shown that no such project is currently being undertaken in the the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, the tickets for flight OA 1222 were paid for from an account that was immediately deactivated after the purchase, while its owner was revealed to be fake.<br><br>Is it possible that the mssing eighty-four willingly left behind their previous lives and cut off all contact with their families? Or maybe the answer is to be found in the shady corners of the international labor market? Let's hope that the reward for any useful information offered by Orbital Air will offer up new leads in this tragic case.<br>q306_dtown_trip_mystery			yes
Article	What Really Happened in Arasaka Tower?	WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN ARASAKA TOWER?<br><br>[...] If Militech was behind the assault on Arasaka Tower in 2023, and if there's actual EVIDENCE to support that, then why didn't Arasaka return the favor and nuke Militech?<br><br>By now there's no doubt the bomb was manufactured by Militech, but that doesn't mean they detonated it. I confess, I'm not a huge fan of the popular theory that Johnny Silverhand, the controversial rockerboy, was behind the whole thing. In fact, I'm not really a Silverhand fan, period. Silverhand was a poser and a blowhard - not someone who would actually follow through on his grandiose bluffs (full disclosure, I just don't think Silverhand would have the balls to pull off something like that).<br><br>Let's think this through - who hates corporations the most?<br><br>Nomads, obviously. Remember that mass-market BD called "Badlands Raid" from the 20s about a band of nomads who attack a Militech convoy? Well, guess when it premiered? That's right - on the night of the attack. Coincidence? I think not.<br><br>Yes, yes, there's a Silverhand cameo in there somewhere, but that's just a marketing ploy - a BD scrolled by a bunch of cactus-huggers wouldn't sell for an enny without a recognizable face. But I'm more intrigued by the main actress - how is it she didn't star in any other production despite "Badlands Raid's" huge sales? Where was she during the attack?

Article	Yikes! Bar Disfigures Little Boy	YIKES! BAR DISFIGURES LITTLE BOY<br><br>It looked normal," said Marlena (43), little Charlie's (10) mother. "I see "All Foods," pretty well-known corp, so I figured I could trust them. I couldn't have been more wrong."<br><br>The tragedy in the Berryman family began one fateful Wednesday morning. Charlie was a little out of sorts that day, so Marlena decided to buy him a soy bar from the SCSM down the hall. "I mean, normally I can't afford luxuries like that," she explained, "but that day, I wanted to give my son a little treat." Unaware of the threat lurking within, she handed the Yikes! bar to Charlie. His first bite would be his last... "All of a sudden, he starts crying, I had no idea what was going on," Marlena wailed. As it turned out, the All Foods bar's consistency... broke little Charlie's tooth! "I dunno what we're going to do, we can't afford a new one." As I listened to her story, Charlie came over to us, tugged on Marlena's sleeve and – despite the tragedy that befell him – showed nothing but gumption and spark. "Mama, don't be sad, next time we'll get a different brand's soy bar," he said before bravely revealing his new gap-toothed grin.<br><br>B.W.<br>mq305_apartment_shard_1			yes

Cyberpsycho	Archived Conversation: Masaki Osawa and Takehiro Chiba	MASAKI OSAWA: Someone zeroed Taki Kazo yesterday. First that accident with Julia, now this.<br><br>TAKEHIRO CHIBA: It all started after our boss Sota was killed. Think they're picking us off one by one?<br><br>MASAKI OSAWA: If they are it's by a trained hand. Taki's head was lopped clean off with a single slice. No spirit could do that, nor a dime-a-dozen streetpunk with a chipped second-hand katana.<br><br>TAKEHIRO CHIBA: So what are you suggesting - one of ours did it?<br><br>MASAKI OZAWA: Taki mentioned an ambush - swore that someone was hiding in a tunnel and watching him like a ghost. I told him it must be all in his head...<br><br>TAKEHIRO CHIBA: Goddamnit... and speaking of - where's Norio been lately? Don't think he was at Julia's funeral. Said it was an attack, said he doesn't believe it was an accident.<br><br>MASAKI OSAWA: I don't know. Last time I saw him, he said he had to meet with Yagyu Tajima-no-kami on a spring day among the cherry blossoms... Maybe the poor guy snapped. I mean, he had a real shock - lost the two people he cared about most at once.<br><br>TAKEHIRO CHIBA: No, no, he didn't go to any cherry blossom garden, those are some old samurai legends he tried to give me recently. He said I should read them and think about what they really mean. He said it was a matter of life and death, that he senses the sakki... Hm, maybe he has gone off in the head.

Cyberpsycho	Archived Conversation: Norio Akuhara and Dr. Colin Thevenaz	NORIO AKUHARA: Hey, those pills you sent me stopped working. But don't worry, I found another way to deal with everything. I found my ZEN and now all those tragedies are like water under the bridge in my garden of peace.<br><br>DR. COLIN THEVENAZ: What about the blackouts, the gaps in your memory? You're not sounding much better. Actually... you sound a bit worse.<br>NORIO AKUHARA: No, no, it wasn't memory loss. I've freed my consciousness now, while then I was somehow shut off, not present. I had to test our people, for they had stopped being present as well. They can't sense the killing, the murderous intentions in the air.<br><br>DR. COLIN THEVENAZ: Um, what sort of test? and why is there blood on Dokuga? What's going on?<br><br>NORIO AKUHARA: I read about the sakki test. I wanted to see if Sota's and Julia's deaths could have been avoided.<br><br>DR. COLIN THEVENAZ: Ok, and what's this test? Did everyone pass?<br><br>NORIO AKUHARA: You have to sense your approaching doom and react accordingly. Unfortunately, none have passed the test so far, so I think I've found the cause for all my suffering. But I still hope, and I will continue my tests.<br><br>DR. COLIN THEVENAZ: You killed people from your own gang?! Norio, put the books down and take your meds!			
Cyberpsycho	Archived Conversation: Saul Bright and Emilia Weiss	EMILIA WEISS: Lost our transport of parts for the new research center. Went missing on Aldecaldo turf.<br><br>SAUL BRIGHT: "Our" meaning whose?<br><br>EMILIA WEISS: Meaning Biotechnica's. But I'm making some private inquiries at the moment. We work on the same turf, but that doesn't mean we have to step on each other's toes.<br><br>SAUL BRIGHT: Not our problem. You're in the Badlands, and out here you stand to run into all sorts of gangs and threats.<br><br>SAUL BRIGHT: Maybe you should have chosen a quieter location for that new center.<br><br>EMILIA WEISS: The nature of the research demands discretion. We need it done out of the way, as far out of the city as possible.<br><br>EMILIA WEISS: If we were to hire someone to track down our cargo... how much would a job like that set us back?<br><br>SAUL BRIGHT: Well, considering the apparent value of the cargo... the price would be high.<br><br>EMILIA WEISS: In eurodollars please, and with a deadline.<br><br>SAUL BRIGHT: Like I said, the price would be high, and not just in eurodollars. We can get those with any contract out here.<br><br>EMILIA WEISS: So what's your ask?<br><br>SAUL BRIGHT: Reverse transpiration xerophytes.<br><br>EMILIA WEISS: But they're not ready for the market yet...<br><br>SAUL BRIGHT: Well put them on the market. A prototype series. That is, unless you're in no hurry.<br><br>EMILIA WEISS: All right, a small prototype batch, but I can't guarantee they'll grow, they're still in the testing phase. They haven't even been planted outside of lab conditions.<br><br>EMILIA WEISS: And what sort of deadline can I count on for the recovery of our cargo?<br><br>SAUL BRIGHT: I'll start looking once those first buds bloom. Shouldn't be too long after.

Cyberpsycho	Doesn't look good	I gotta say, that Mary of yours sure has a head on her shoulders. She got you here at the last possible moment. Your body's rejecting the implants, and no wonder - it's not ready for them. They're military-grade, you can't use them without the proper training. Christ, they're not for civilian use at all. I can give you a scrip for painkillers, but don't forget - the pain is your body's way of warning you. If you ignore it and keep using that chrome, you could cause permanent damage to your spine. You might be able to take off that exoskeleton now, but if you break your spine you'll never move on your own again.			
Cyberpsycho	Don't come	Don't come here - there's no point. Russel's completely lost it. It's not safe here.<br><br>I'm trying to be understanding, I know what he's been through - I even scolded our son for being selfish and trying to escape.<br><br>Now I know he was right - getting out is the only way. I can't even talk to Russel like a normal person anymore. Last week he laid new mines and forgot to tell me about them - one step in the wrong direction and that would've been the end of me. This house is starting to look more like a prison. Still, at least in prison you know what to expect, but here...?	SlappinFace	dont_come

Cyberpsycho	Farewell	Tamara! I've been trying to reach you ever since they took me. I know you're looking and I know you'll find me eventually but I don't know how to make it any easier. Don't think I can get on the net. I should've listened when you taught me how but now i fucked myself... Honestly I don't even think you'll recognize me if you saw me. I know I don't... Should just stick a barrel down my throat and be done with it I'm such a fucking monster. FUCK ME!!!! Gang ain't taking me back - not without a bag over my head... I got these like tractor hands and ugly as sin red eyes.<br><br>All I can thinnk[sic] of now is your chooms who poisoned you to me, telling you not to get with a Valentino, that he'll leave you for someone else, vanish without a word... I'm gone an they'll beat their chests all justified and tell you "told you so" but couldn't be more wrong. It's driving me loco I feel like my head's gonna explode in a million pieces. I can feel the pressure building and building and building but idk when it's gonna pop

Cyberpsycho	Glitter 	Oh, Alec, my dear Alec.<br><br>I told you to stay away from glitter. That stuff is cooked to get you hooked. Why it hurts so bad when I try to get oof it, the pain's designed to resist and drugs or editors.<br><br>Only thing that could help is paramotacol from Bodyweight Life Preservation Systems.<br><br>Far as I can tell, they've got some in one of their warehouses in Little China. Problem is, paramotacol costs and arm and a leg, and you're gonna have to pop it like Leelou Beans for a while to keep the glitter-jitters at bay.			
Cyberpsycho	I knew this would happen!	They did it - they finally got us. While I was testing my netrunner chair - one split-second of distraction was all it took. Must've dialed it up too far, short-circ'd the grid, coils blew. When the wife came to see what happened, all hell broke loose. I knew one day this would happen. I did all I could to protect them, but they were all so careless! See what happens when you don't LISTEN?! You get ripped to shreds! I thought I'd prepared myself for the worst-case scenario, but nothing can prepare you for this kind of carnage. And just when we were a hair's breadth away from being 100% safe - that ICE was supposed to protect us from backdoor net attacks - the last place they'd get us. If only they just stayed inside... I could still protect them! What fucking good is all this security now? I don't give a shit - they can come for me! I'll put up a hell of a fight - take those hive-mind fuckers with me. They'll regret they ever messed with Sam Milton[sic]. Come at me, motherfuckers! I'm right here!

Cyberpsycho	Message to Dao Hyunh	My dear sister,<br><br>The time of revenge and the white light, of frost-white chrome and contempt has come!<br><br>When you wake in the cold fluorescent light, remember how you humiliated me at my wedding. How I became the laughing stock of Night City thanks to you and your Mr. Stud prank.<br><br>I hope you'll enjoy my revenge, as I've chosen the most hideous implants from Jig-Jig's nastiest ripperdocs to make a few adjustments to your oh so beautiful body. Ah, and I almost forgot to mention... I'm getting married again! My future husband needs no introduction because he's your fiance after all and you know him so well. That's right - Kenny. But don't worry about him, I doubt he'll spot the difference. He's never been too observant that one. I really hope you enjoy the craftsmanship and effort and I poured into your new shell. It's the perfect match for the monster inside you. And I'm sorry to do this, but you're not welcome at the wedding. I'd hate to scare off all my friends and guests. Or even Kenny! XD I'll be sure to send you some stills taken from outside your favorite restaurant so you can always know what your life might have looked like. Stay strong, sis. And stay away from mirrors.<br><br>Your favorite sister,<br><br>Linh xoxo			
Cyberpsycho	Message to Linh Hyunh	My dearest Linh,<br><br>I heard you've been worrying about security at the wedding. Well, put it out of your mind! As one of our biggest stars, you know that your comfort and peace of mind is our top priority. I would never, ever let your sister ruin your big day. I'll see to it myself; you have my word. Your safety comes first and that will never change... even if you lost your looks, your talent... never, no matter what. Besides, Dao's in a coma and will only wake up once you and Kenny are out sipping watermelon mojitos on the beach. So chin up, and don't worry or you'll get fine lines - remember, your skin needs time to recover after the transplant.<br><br>Yours always,<br><br>Celine

Cyberpsycho	Saigon Sisters' - TREATMENT	The scene opens with a close-up on KENNY and LINH posing for wedding pictures by a seaside cafe (sign and logo visible in the background, slight blurring but still legible.)<br><br>Scene shot against the sun, with a slight glow and lens flare. Typical lively wedding music plays in the background, while the wedding guests' conversations are a dull roar punctuated with a loud laugh and cheerful shouts.<br><br>Sudden change of mood, the music shifts to something more ominous, while the sound of a motorboat engine roars louder, obviously approaching at high speed.<br><br>Next scene is overcast, the motorboat reaches the shore. Camera: pan in on the figure on the motorboat. It's a terrifying double of Linh, borged out and with a face contorted in pain and rage. It's Linh's sister, DAO. Dao angrily confronts her sister, accusing her of putting her into a coma by spiking her wine, then installing the worst combat implants in her while she was unconscious. Dao lifts her arms to reveal the implants - the colorful party lights glint and dance on her chrome forearms. Linh's face turns to stone in terror, and the music soars in a dramatic crescendo. Close up on Kenny's confused face, his eyes darting from one sister to another.<br><br>Dao hurls herself at her sister, but security steps in at the last moment and they all tumble into the waves. The final scene of the season comes to an end with a loud splash. END SCENE.			
Cyberpsycho	Send a crew	One of my workers went cyberpsycho thanks to your fucking exoskeleton! He's out here destroying the whole building, my life's work!

Cyberpsycho	Stop! Don't do it	Let this be a warning to anyone thinking about buying this shop. Don't be fooled by the fantastic location or top-shelf equipment. Because guess what?! None of it will be yours, even after you sign whatever agreement the corp gives you. What, you surprised? Well, so was I. I shouldn't have been, though. It was right there in front of my eyes, in black and white. I didn't want to waste my time reading some complicated agreement with more twists than that apple novel by a certain Virginia. I also didn't bother doing my research, or else I would have found out the shop changed hands three times already this year, and the previous owners disappeared without a trace - except their debts, that is. All I can say is, I've dealt with my fair share of gangs looking for protection money or a one-time heist, but nobody, and I mean nobody, has ever fucked me over quite like the suits at Zetatech. So I've got only one answer for them: a wrench to the face and a vise for their fingers.			
Cyberpsycho	The hard reset approacheth	The boys have prepared everything and found me a lamb. Blood will course through the fiberoptics, swirling and blending with the digital, opening the gates of the abyss. Death within arm's reach, the metallic taste of his scythe on my tongue, I will tug at the tangled cables of Fate. A hard reset, a blue screen, a brain reformatted... I'm ready. Luck be with me.			
Cyberpsycho	Ticket to the Major Leagues	Blake,<br><br>Stop acting like a child. I know you read these even if you want me to think you don't give a shit by never responding.<br><br>Work in NC is going fine even if the competition is deadly fierce and I had to invest more in my new chromework than we originally planned. Honestly, it's was kinda hard to find myself in my new me if you know what I mean. I sorta felt out of body? Idk. But all's fixed and we're nova now. Most importantly, I know we're so close to the job that's gonna take us next level. I can feel it in my new, titanium-reinforced bones.<br><br>Once I land the gig, I'm gonna kill it in a blaze of chrome, fire and style. Then we'll get the life we've always deserved.<br><br>Missing you and loving you,<br><br>Alec

His music will allow you to take a deep breath and regain perspective.<br><br>For me, Entolim's track "LIT" evokes more of a feeling than an explicit message. Extension beyond the individual, maybe? Seemingly about the search for common desire and meaning, it sure gets my gears a-turnin', of that there's no doubt. And Entolim's vocal performance is like honey in my ears.<br><br>Read more about Entolim on the Growl FM netpage!			yes

Leaflet	Kurt Hansen's Wake	According to documents provided by law firm Asukaga & Finch, apparently it was Kurt Hansen's last will to be cremated and have his ashes scattered over a particular storm channel in Dogtown "with the accompaniment of live Balkan folk music." Unfortunately, for obvious reasons, we cannot accomodate[sic] his final wishes. The people need to see the body of their leader, their contractor, their friend. Instead, we will honor him with a send-off befitting his position – one that will leave nothing to doubt and speculation. We've decided to hold a wake for him at the Black Sapphire. It should be a respectful, open-casket service, appropriate for remembering his life, his death and his legacy. Snacks and beverages should also be provided. We expect many of Hansen's foreign associates to attend, so everything has to be perfect.<br><br>Jago			yes

Leaflet	Mr. Kipper: A Universal Message	DJ, composer, producer, radio host, performer, Crystal Palace resident. Although all of the above is true, Mr. Kipper describes himself first and foremost as a Highrider. His music, on the other hand, defies all labels. The self-taught musical savant has five albums and nine EPs to his credit, all of which have helped skyrocket his popularity throughout the solar system.<br><br>Mr. Kipper's latest singles, "Choke Hold" and "Rolla", immediately took over the "Top 10 Thumpers of the Month" list put out by interplanetary radio station Dark Star. "I communicate through rhythm", explained the artist. "It's the only language we can all understand without need of translation software." Judging by the turnout on Mr. Kipper's recent Earth tour, it certainly seems his message is getting through loud and clear.<br><br>Mr. Kipper told us that he bellieves[sic] his set lists are much more than a dynamic mix of styles and genres. "Every sound carries meaning – a call for freedom." This proud Highrider, with liquified[sic] stardust pumping through his veins, values freedom of thought and expression above all else. Mr. Kipper's newly established terrestrial radio station, 99.9 Impulse, is a medium that he believes will unite listeners across and beyond all boundaries – the same boundaries he himself has already transcended.			yes
Leaflet	Nomads for the Thick-Skinned	OK, the matter's simple - whatever you read or hear about the nomads in the city media doesn't hold an ounce of water. The biggest lie bandied around is that being a nomad is a "job." It's not. Nomadism is a lifestyle. See, if you want to know something about nomads, all you have to do is ask one yourself. Luckily, I already know the questions because I've been asked them a thousand times. So let's get started, shall we?<br><br>1. Why did the nomads organize themselves? Well, why NOT unite millions of people roaming around the country? Besides, if know what you're looking for, you'll instantly know which clan a nomad belongs to. Which brings us to our next point - nomads are divided into nations. Nations are divided into clans. Clans are broken down into families. You'll recognize them from their colors, their jackets and the decals on their cars and bikes. By the way, nomads take their affiliation seriously, so unless you want a broken jaw, I'd advise you do the same.<br><br>2. You'll be eating dirt or worse if you get nomads and raffens mixed up. Remember - Raffen Shiv are NOT nomads. They're pariahs, outcasts, criminals who were either exiled from their clan for doing something truly effed up, or just ordinary city criminals on the run. Raffens form packs not because it's convenient, but because they don't have a choice. Nobody in their right mind would work with them, unless they somehow fit in your plans. Mostly they rob and pillage. Don't ask me where the name "Raffen Shiv" comes from. All's I know is that apparently it means something really dirty.<br><br>3. Nomads take on all kinds of jobs - everybody has to eat, right? What kinds of jobs they take depends on the clan or family's particular strategy. Some pick crops in agrocorp fields, others deal with corp shipments or protect their convoys. If you want to smuggle something across the border, you go to the nomads. If you need to vanish off your pissed-off creditors' or shareholders' radar, the nomads will take you so far into the boonies you'll be shitting next to scorpions. You pay, they do the job, you shake hands, and everyone goes their separate ways.<br><br>Get it now? If you want more specifics, just grow a pair and talk to a real nomad. Good luck.			
Leaflet	Note to the press on the Texas border situation	President Rosalind Myers expresses her deep regret at the escalation of conflict along the border of the Republic of Texas. As the president states: "One can't remove a vital organ from the state and assume that it will continue to function properly."<br><br>The president will not resume talks with the Texas government on opening the border to free trade and immigration until the government manages to get the terrorist threat under control.<br><br>Myers added that the NUS Armed Forces are ready at any moment to aid Texas citizens in their fight against terrorism. "Just say the word, and this nightmare can be a thing of the past. You'll be able to return home, to American soil."<br><br>RM: OK, just drop the organ bit, muddles the message			yes

Expect this song to be an introduction to the larger artistic vision they intend to bring to audiences with NoWorld in the near future. Hold on to your neurons, folks – shit's about to get electric.<br><br>The artists haven't revealed much about themselves on a personal level, so if you're curious, it looks like you're gonna have to dive into the world they've built to learn a little more about the people behind the music. Whatever this BD experience turns out to be, I have high hopes after hearing this absolute banger of a track!<br><br>Read more about NoiR, Haizumi and Yassun on the Growl FM netpage!			yes

Leaflet	Pathology of the Badlands	Have you ever dreamed of leaving the city for a life on the road? Has your child ever told you they dream of becoming a nomad adventurer?<br><br>MISTAKE!<br><br>The romanticization of these "brave highway pirates" is as common as it is harmful.<br><br>These drifters are NOT as mysterious or noble as you might think. No! In fact, they are no different from any criminal organization (although even "organization" may be a stretch). These wandering bands are no more than chaotic jumbles of trigger-happy anarchists roaming just outside the margins of civilization. Descended primarily from the largely extinct agrarian society of the Californias and beyond, these outsiders have rejected the amenities of modernity and chosen instead a path of bloody revolt. They make rusted trucks and trailers their homes, denying themselves the basic necessities of running water and SCSMs! All of this squalor... by choice. Is this yet proof enough of their insanity?<br><br>Of course, they do manage to scrape together just enough to survive. How, you ask? Without factories, hotels, restaurants and bars? They attack us... The transports of weapons and food destined for our businesses and dinner tables. As if not shamed enough already, they smuggle psychoactive drugs across our borders... even known murders and rapists. It's true! And even they themselves are known to whore themselves out for contract killings... the bloodiest and most brutal that no one else would dare accept.<br><br>You might think these self-proclaimed rebels, these "fighters for a cause," would have some semblance of camaraderie. Nothing could be further from the truth. These scattered gangs of vagabonds and drifters are divided into dozens if not HUNDREDS of smaller subgroups who are at each other's throats more often than not. One day they unify to hijack a textile transport, the next they murder each other in cold blood as they sleep Even their children join in on the bloodbath... While our kids receive games and toys for their birthdays, theirs are given rifles and rusty blades! But don't blame the children - blame the parents for depriving them of a happy and fulfilling future! And for what? Some illusion of freedom? Obscured by a shroud of resentment and envy? Each of them has the potential to become a future technician, NetWatch agent, or even CEO.<br><br>But instead they'll die alone in the desert, buried in the sand - all for a couple of ennies or pouch of drugs...

Leaflet	Private Press: Who, Where, and When?	Just what do the faces under those iconic epoxy space helmets look like? Members of the DJ duo Private Press, Adam Brocki and Jan Wóycicki, have long refused to reveal their identities. All we know for sure is that they both hail from Grobel Orbital Station, thousands of miles from Earth.<br><br>The duo identify with the cultural heritage of the Highriders, which has proved an inexhaustible source of inspiration for their craft. Brocki explained how he felt they were "incredibly lucky to be born at a time and place that is such a rich amalgam of terrestrial and extraterrestrial influences." With a twinkle in his visor, Wóycicki added: "In space, our neurons collide at the speed of sound."<br><br>Through what feels like a paradox of space-time itself, Private Press have managed to somehow imbue their music with a freshness that also has staying power. Their latest set, created for 99.9 Impulse in collaboration with cosmic music scene megastar Mr. Kipper, is thumping in clubs from Melbourne to Lima. Audiences have raved over the experimental, expressive sound that dazzles, hypnotizes and has you feeling like you're floating in zero-g.<br><br>When asked about their plans for the near future, Brocki and Wóycicki kept us guessing with their ever-present poker faces. "Time is a flat circle," Brocki finally said. Sensing our confusion, Wóycicki offered some "clarity" on the duo's future: "We won't be leaving Earth's orbit anytime soon."			yes

Leaflet	Red Dead Roadkill	When you tune in to Growl FM, you tune in to the latest news from the best independent music artists. Here's a taste!<br><br>Red Dead Roadkill – a band shaped by destiny, tragedy, grit and gang connections. The amount of shit they've endured together as a group could have just as easily destroyed them as it did forge them into an absolute musical force. Their sound has thus evolved and matured, which has me beyond excited and curious for their upcoming releases.<br><br>But for now check out their track "Flatline" – guaranteed goosebumps or your money back! It's inspired by the depths of personal connection as well as loss and fear. Some aspects of life are the kind we must endure together, and we're all more delicate than we'd like to admit.<br><br>Read more about Red Dead Roadkill on the Growl FM netpage!			yes

Do we know what happened? Not really! To be honest, sounds to me like they learned a truth about music marketing early on – a pinch of mystery adds tons of flavor!<br><br>When you form a bond with someone that runs as deep as theirs, you hold onto it. Better yet – you use that bond as a platform for expression, like these two have done with their music. Give their song "El Tiempo" a listen and you'll understand what I mean. Laura and Michi struck a chord with me, and I have a feeling their sound will resonate with you too.<br><br>Read more about Skin on Flesh on the Growl FM netpage!			yes

Leaflet	St. Aurora	When you tune in to Growl FM, you tune in to the latest news from the best independent music artists. Here's a taste!<br><br>A mysterious band of exiles that rolls with the Wraiths, and a band of... well, y'know, the kind of band that makes music. St. Aurora is a group composed of five talented artists who contribute different genres and styles to give the band its own unique sound. It's strong. It's fiery. It's rebellious. It doesn't give a shit if it's different. If they ever put on a concert within city limits, you'll hear about it first from Growl FM!<br><br>Check out their song "Going to Heaven". It was like a gateway drug that got me hooked on the rest of their stuff. Strong, powerful, forceful, and er... I dunno – they have more genres than I do adjectives to describe their sound. I just know it makes me wanna put my fist in the fuckin' air! What more can you ask for?!<br><br>Read more about St. Aurora on the Growl FM netpage!			yes
Leaflet	Thai McGrath (ft. JustCosplaySings)	When you tune in to Growl FM, you tune in to the latest news from the best independent music artists. Here's a taste!<br><br>Thai McGrath and JustCosplaySings are a duo that some superfans might recognize from their work in braindance. It's not easy to get your hands on their BDs nowadays, but I was lucky enough to relive two of 'em. Totally by accident, by the way. I get goosebumps just thinking about it.<br><br>Their journey to deliver full sensory experiences eventually narrowed to focus solely on sound. Music, more specifically. They realized this was the magic stuff that fuels their creativity. Also, by choosing to center their craft on music, they opened to the door for listeners to add to that experience in their own way. It's difficult to describe what I mean exactly, but give their track "Afterlife" a listen and you'll know what I mean. They've left a lot of space in their music for you to add something of your own – a space for the free flow of your own emotions and associations. Maybe they realized, in this way, that music can offer more than a braindance ever could? Give it a listen and let me know your thoughts!<br><br>Read more about Thai McGrath and JustCosplaySings on the Growl FM netpage!			yes
Leaflet	The Foodie Guide to Night City	The world traveler in Night City is faced with a dilemma: Enjoy the local cuisine? Or save their gut the trouble? If you don't own a Trauma Team policy, you're probably better off sticking to the tried-and-tested chains and exclusive restaurants. But if you do, Night City is full of risk that packs a lot of reward. Here's our risk-reward breakdown of Night City's good eats.<br><br>For the cautious consumer:<br><br>Bleu - A gourmet dining experience with some of the highest accolades and richest portfolios in the city. If you're after high-quality, locally sourced ingredients, Bleu is the place for you. Among its marquee dishes are authentic caviar, oysters, and imported Prosecco. The alabaster white interior adorned with minimalist décor[sic] is perfect for a relaxing night out following a day of hustle and bustle.<br><br>Pepper & Spice - A unique locale on the culinary map of Night City. This eatery was founded by renowned travel icon Tony Haleek. It stands apart from the competition thanks to its diverse menu of transcontinental fusion dishes, most of which are offered at surprisingly reasonable prices. Caribbean, Polish, Kenyan - it's all here. Just not in the combination you've ever seen before... The crowd favorite? Haleek's own vanilla dumplings.<br><br>For the gutsy gourmand:<br><br>Buck-A-Slice - According to urban legend, the NCPD has en[sic] entire file on the mysterious deaths of homeless people whose last meal was pizza from Buck-A-Slice. True or not, bargain-seekers living on a eurodollar-a-lunch budget should still be prepared for gastrointestinal distress. Worth the risk? Only if you want a greasy slice of authentic Night City flavor. Plus, their secret recipe chilispurt scopperoni is unlike anything you've ever tasted, but only available on special request.<br><br>Ru Lai - At Ru Lai you'll find all of the three P's - potent, punchy and pungent. Every visit to this local favorite is like playing a game of Chinese roulette. Regulars at Ru Lai claim you're just as likely to get "bearable" egg rolls and "halfway decent" rangoons as you are tainted tofu or Sichuan salmonella. You've been warned.

Leaflet	Your God, Your Kiroshi	The Catholic Church has never taken an official stance on implants, but the significant presence of all matter of bodily modifications among the clergy would seem to suggest (just like in other branches of Christianity) that implants are completely acceptable in the eyes of the Church.<br><br>The Mormon faith holds a different view - according to their tenets, no God-fearing Mormon can sport body-modifying implants, whether for aesthetic or functional purposes, the sole exception being life-supporting or other strictly health-related cyberware.<br><br>When it comes to the Islamic faith, imams regularly speak out against cyberware, though actual possession of bodily modifications is not officially barred.<br><br>Judaism does not have any provisions on implants, with the exception of Hassidic communities, where they are regulated individually by the community's tzaddik.			
Literature	1,000 Beats a Second	I couldn't believe my eyes. For a moment, I thought Jessica had changed them out for faulty Kiroshis while I was asleep. But no, that wouldn't have been like her. I blinked again. No change. There I saw them, clear as day, the open flaps of Jason's chrome skull. I saw the electronic brain that, up until now, had been hidden by perfect imitation syn-skin.<br><br>The son of FutureTech CEO, the boy of my damn dreams, Jason... He was an android. Shit...<br><br>I sat there stuck with a dumb expression on my face and Jason stared back with one of his own. I couldn't help but wonder now... were those beautiful eyes of his - the same that had pierced my soul - were they merely a mimicry controlled by some emo-algorithm? Had there never been anything real behind them all those times? ... Not once?<br><br>"Alex!...I-it's not what you think!" he pleaded with a strangely authentic note of panic in his voice. And I wanted to believe him. I really did.<br><br>"Hmph... Well, clearly it hasn't been," I replied in equal parts anxious and bitter. "Me and my rotten luck... The first and last guy I fall for and he turns out to be a goddamn motherboard on legs!"<br><br>"No, that's not--," Jason suddenly broke off and smiled awkwardly. "Wait, did you... did you say 'fall for?'"<br><br>My cardio implant began to beat more and more quickly. My face flushed. Had I been wrong? Could this body of bolts, wires, and plastic contain whatever is left of the real Jason Cadalez? If his father was able to design a synthetic heart for me, maybe he could do the same for his son's brain. The question is... why?

After all, our days on this blue speck of dirt are numbered, are they not? Very strictly numbered, in fact, thanks to this plethora of technology that surrounds us and permeates our bodies. But that's all fine and dandy, isn't it? Just know this: only a few decades ago people were still attached to their body as something that justified their existence and foregrounded their identity. Know this: less than a century ago, implantation was still considered to be invasive - an attack on our fundamental, physical connection to reality. And now? Your body is only a spare part, your existence is upgradeable, and your here-and-now is constantly getting outdated. So who ARE you? You're temporary. Expendable. Replaceable. Feel that, know that, and you'll regain your freedom.	Gandair	chrome_and_you	
Literature	Chrome Night Love	Chroman's mask glinted in the light of the setting sun, like a beacon in the dark of this rotten city. Lucille's heartbeat began to quicken. Her legs trembled beneath her, hot blood pumped through her veins in a way she didn't know it could.<br><br>He looked at her, his strong, masculine figure towering over the bloodied corporate corpse, which just a moment ago had violently tried to defile Lucille's virtue.<br><br>"What's the matter with me?" her mind raced. "Why him? Why me?" Hundreds of questions burned inside her brain. But, when she finally parted her lips to speak, only one question emerged: "Who are you really?"<br><br>Chroman took Lucille into his cold, metal hands. She flinched at the touch. "You know I can't tell you that. They'll find you, they'll rip my secret out you any way they can... and then kill you.<br><br>"I--I don't care about any of that! I love you... I love you!"<br><br>She couldn't feel his face, his real one, concealed under that veil of chrome, but she could have sworn she could hear a note of emotion in his deep voice.<br><br>"You love a dream. You don't know who hides under this mask."<br><br>"I don't care what you look like."<br><br>"What if I'm disfigured?"<br><br>"I'll pay for the operation."<br><br>"And if I'm an android?"<br><br>"It doesn't matter!"<br><br>"And if..." Then, suddenly, in one swift motion, Chroman removed the mask to reveal... the face of Damita de la Veli! "... if I'm a woman?"<br><br>Lucille stood there, dumbstruck. A tempest of emotion swirled in a frenzy throughout her being. But after a moment passed, the storm calmed and she smiled warmly, taking her savior's face into her hands. The proverbial clouds of her tumultuous mind began to part. Lucille was beginning to see clearly at last. "How many times does a woman need to say she loves you," Lucille smirked and whispered softly, "before you believe her?"

Saburo Arasaka is displeased with the progress of his son Kei, who is commanding Arasaka's forces. He instructs Kei to defeat the enemy in order to prove himself as a worthy successor.

Their conversation is overheard by Sara, a Militech agent and also the beloved adoptive daughter of General Donald Lundee. Sara concludes that the only way to quickly end the bloody conflict is to assassinate Kei.<br>General Lundee comforts his daughter and gives her courage.<br><br>Soon, Andrew - a young idealist and idolater of Saburo - arrives in Night City. His dream is to find the last living seagull in the world, so he attempts to stow away aboard an Arasaka ship. Then, he is discovered, apprehended, and mocked by Arasaka security personnel.<br><br>Meanwhile, Sara is preparing her ambush against Kei, who is due to inspect the ship the very same day. When her target appears, Sara is poised to fire her gun when, suddenly, her eyes lock with Andrew's. Time stops, sparks fly, young love is born.

With a father's love, he is able to forgive her, comfort her, and offer her a chance at redemption.

Andrew erroneously accuses Militech of destroying the original coral reef, causing Sara to realize that her beloved has become a member of Arasaka's security forces.<br><br>Both corporations are preparing for the final confrontation. Andrew and Sara mourn their unrequited love. General Lundee worries over the risk his soldiers face. Saburo reminds his son that he has only one more chance to earn his father's pride and respect.

The two lovers meet as battle rages on around them, but neither can bring themself to harm the other. Kei attempts to detonate the bomb in Andrew's heart but the detonator fails.

Literature	Crimeblock	McCrane scanned the room with a deft Kiroshi sweep. This corpse was no different than the dozens he'd seen over the years. The dead man's eyes frozen in fear, his ligaments, wires and intestines strewn about the floor - none of it made any impact on McCrane anymore.<br><br>"I've lived too long," he thought. "And cops who don't die quick usually find themselves playing for the other side eventually."<br><br>"This case is as clear as a used napkin at Deputy Zhao's," he murmured to Junior Inspector Malinowski. "Cyberpsycho. Came in through the window. Victim let him inside, must've known each other. Prints are all over the glass."<br><br>"Holy shit..." Malinowski shook his head in disbelief. "How'd the fucker get all the way up to the eleventh floor?"<br><br>"See those grooves on the windowsill? Climbing spikes, implants kids these days are gettin' installed to pull stupid rooftop stunts, get cheap thrills..."<br><br>Malinowski made his way over to the window to examine the evidence his superior had so effortlessly pieced together. The veteran detective lit a cigarette and stared back into the corpse's lifeless eyes. Although McCrane had never seen this man before, he felt as if he had known him a long time. And still... he felt nothing for him. No pity, no compassion. This was only a body now, no longer a person.<br><br>Suddenly, Malinowski's unsteady voice woke McCrane from his thoughts. "Uh... boss? These prints on the outside of the window...? They... they belong to you."<br><br>McCrane let out a quick, punctuating chuckle. "Never much took you for a jokester, Malinowski," the detective said with an amused smirk as he rolled up his sleeves to expose his wrists. "And I wonder... just how would I get there without any climber's claws, hm?"<br><br>But before the junior inspector could respond, McCrane felt an uneasiness shoot up his spine. This room, this man, the smell of his blood... He felt compelled to walk over to the savaged victim and reach inside his pocket. A photo. His own face staring back at him.<br><br>Malinowski slowly drew his pistol. "I believed in you," the shaken proté<br>gé uttered with a pain in his voice. "All this time... I idolized a-a murderer.""I... I don't understand," muttered McCrane, scarcely loud enough to hear his own voice. Something else began to drown out his words, even his thoughts - a strange, primal force. "For the first time in my life... I don't understand."<br><br>And then-CRACK-a gunshot.

He loved this time of day because the red in the sky made him think about the bomb that would bring down the corpo system and because it reminded him of how fleeting life is. Then all the sudden the smell of bacon snapped him out of his deep thoughts. He threw his mug and swore cuz it was definitely that bitch Alt who was trying to impress him with breakfast again. Johnny flipped back his oil black hair and groaned. He thought, This stupid girl won't leave me alone!<br><br>Even though he was brooding and clenching his square jaw in anger he still put on his dog tags and a little makeup to go downstairs for breakfast. But then when he got to the kitchen he was stunned! It wasn't Alt... It was Kerry Eurdoyne[sic]!<br><br>- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE???!!!!!1 - he asked in total shock and wiped a lock of thick black hair from his eyes. Kerry stood there with a frying pan in his hand with a surprised look at Johnny's outburst.<br><br>- Umm... I'm making you eggs - he said and his face turned bright red like a pepperoni. Then a second later the two rockerstuds both noticed the smoky smell of burning bacon. Kerry's deep brown eyes turned to the nanoburner and he tried to turn it off, but then he accidentially turned it up even higher and the whole nanostove burst into flames!!<br><br>Wow, Johnny calmly thought looking at his choom panicing and tying to put out the fire. How is this klutzy gonk even in my band? But before he could make fun of him or laught or anything Johnny heard a loud crash and a mysterious figure landed really close to him... It was Toshiro! The infamous Arasaka corpothug!!!<br><br>-It's over for you, Silverhand! - said the japanese agent with an evil smile and then he fired at the silver-armed legend. No - Johnny thought to himself. It can't end this way. There are still corps I have to destroy, I have so much left to do... I have to... I have to tell Kerry that I love him... Yes, it was when he was spitting up blood on the floor and flexing his sweaty biceps and abs in pain that the raven haried rockerboy realized he loved Kerry... even if he was terrible at making breakfast. But there wasnt anymore time to tell him how he felt... He couldn't move or talk the pain was so bad... And then - darkness...<br><br>But then with the last of his strenght he saw Kerry kneel down next to him and slit his wrist with a steak knife.<br><br>- Wjat... are you... doing... - Johnny asked in horrible pain.<br><br>- Shut up and drink, you leadhead. I'm saving your ass. Im a half-demon half-angel and my blood holds the power of eternal life. I already killed Toshiro with a single strike of my other demon power that I always use to crush corposcum.<br><br>-You crazy son of a bitch, Eurodyne... - he said half conscience as he tasted the metallic taste of blood and looked deeply into Kerry's almond eyes... Kerry, listen... I love you, you... (cough) you damn fool... then Johnny passed out and a sweaty lock of jetblack hair fell across his face.<br><br>- I know, Kerry said and smiled with a tear in his eye... And because he felt the same way he put his lips on Johnny's and kissed him warmly and softly, the tear falling on his cheek... Then he smiled, breathed deeply and slowly and whispered in Johnny's ear- And now we'll always be together... <3 <3 <3<br><br>Lily Silverhand, 2021	Hailios	fanfiction_an_omelet_of_passion

It was raining really heavy and lightning lit up the sky. Kerry was flying over megabuildings and his white angel wings flapped in the wind like big patio umbrellas. He was holding Johnny Silverhand in his arms who is actually really afraid of heights. He didn't want to admit it but because he never looked down and he hugged Kerry really tight Kerry cuold tell.<br><br>– Is it cuddle time already, Johnny? – Kerry chuckled and his almond eyes twinkled.<br><br>– Shut up.... – grumbled Johnny - I'm just being careful is all. Remember when you dropped my birthday cake?? (it's ok they still ate it. It was triple chocolate with cherries :P)<br><br>– Don't worry, I'd never let you go. – But then Kerry suddenly stopped smiling and got serious. – Johnny, you have to promise me you'll be careful in the tower...<br><br>Oh yeah.

Then Johnny reached into his pants and grabbed his........ gun xD and strutted inside.<br><br>Sneaking around isn't the Silverhand way, so he shot at the guards to make them run and hide.

Saburo Arasaka himself!!!<br><br>– What are you here, Silverhand? – the old man asked angerily, but it also sounded kind of graceful.<br><br>– I'm here to destroy you!! - Johnny shouted, flipping back his jet black hair and pointing the gun at an angle right at Saburo.<br><br>– You cannot...<br><br>– Oh yeah?! And why's that old man??<br><br>– Because you... – Saburo paused dramatically – ...are my son.<br><br>The rockerboy's chiseled jaw literally fell to the floor.<br><br>– WHAAAAT?!1? No way!

Want me to kill him with my demon powers???<br><br>– No. – Silverhand replied – Saburo, this is my fiancé, Kerry Eurodyne. Kerry, this is... my dad.<br><br>Kerry's eyes opened wide from shock and then he fainted. A single tear rolled down Saburo's old wrinkly cheek.<br><br>– Arigato... my son.<br><br>Lily Silverhand, 2022			yes
Literature	In the Shade of an Apple Tree, by Virginia Granchester	My first memory isn't an image or a sound, but a smell. The smell of rotting apples - intense and dizzyingly sweet. I must've been around four. We were spending the summer at my grandparents' house. They had a small orchard with this old, huge apple tree by the fence. That year it grew so many apples that nobody even bothered to pick them. We just watched them fall to the ground, where they lay rotting.<br><br>It's hard to imagine now - a world where things used to grow out of the ground without our help, without bioengineering. Where an apple was something normal - a fruit whose shape and taste every child knew by instinct.<br>Where a normal person, like my granddad, could have more than he needed.<br><br>Sometimes I think back to that orchard and that sweet, drowsy smell. But all I taste is bitterness.			
Literature	Kibble and Scop	Kibble stared glumly at his glass of a seaweed-colored drink. A part of him hoped the bartender had poured a pint of rat poison by mistake. "I don't get it, choom...", he murmured gloomily. "At school, they said I had talent, a real knack for acting. Was it all a fucking lie, or what?"<br><br>"Dude, there are billions of people on this rock," Scop shrugged. "Can't work out for everyone."<br><br>Kibble flicked on his olfactory booster and gave his beverage a whiff. Smelled just like the wet mop in the bathroom - maybe worse. Then, not knowing why, he suddenly recalled the merc he talked to a week ago in a popular punk dive he liked to frequent. Well, okay, maybe "talked" is generous, but grievances were certainly aired. The merc swept the floor with him that night and threatened to put a bullet between his tonsils if he ever spilled her tequila again.<br><br>This is it, he thought. Rotgut and tequila. Unemployed losers and hotshit mercs. The latter with the world at their feet. It's people like Kibble who are just a theater set piece, who make up the backdrop against which the Sandevistan-boosted mercs of the world can shine bright as stars. Kibble decided then and there that he didn't want to be just a splotch in the background anymore.<br><br>"Why? Why doesn't it ever shake out for us?", he asked with sour grimace. "Why does this city only reward bloodthirsty, bulletcrazy punks while the rest of us normal saps without murderous tendencies have to huddle over our cheap glasses of green cockroach piss?"<br><br>Scop shrugged again. "I dunno, find a gun, buy an edgy jacket," he suggested indifferently with a note of sarcasm. "Shoot up some gang haunts. Have the punkiest time of your life for four and a half seconds."<br><br>"What the hell happened here?" Kibble continued his rant. "The world's all upside-down! There are billions just like you and me. Billions of do-nothings, cowards... No, not cowards - people who just want things to be normal! Safety. Life... Life, Scop!"<br><br>Scop had already opened his mouth, ready to list off another round of cynical retorts, but then stopped himself short and started a tangent of his own. ife..." he repeated slowly and ponderously. "What if I could sell the world... an alternate life? The same all those edgerunners feel, except where you won't ever die like they do."<br><br>Kibble snorted and spat out the cockroach piss he finally mustered the courage to taste. "Sorry to burst your bubble, choom, but somebody's way ahead of ya there. Ever heard of Bloody Bout IV? Or, like... a million other computer games?"<br><br>Scop cracked a roguish smile. "Is Bloody Bout IV or these 'million other games' designed to work on a hybrid braindance system? Y'know, the kind I made a breakthrough on just last week?"

Literature	Mutant by Moonlight	It was a night like every other. An oppressive black smog choked the city, pouring into the wicked hearts and lungs that breathed there. Acid rain drummed against thousands of window panes, the cityscape like a surreal tessellation of piano keys. Thirty years came and went; nothing changed. I stood at the window, smoking cigarette after cigarette, my thoughts distracted by the memory of a woman I hadn't seen since the war's end.<br><br>And then I heard a knock a the door. Just like her... Just like thirty years ago.<br><br>"Come in," the hoarse words strained from my throat as I mechanically lifted my hand to the wall panel. The metal door slid open noiselessly, revealing a slender figure draped snugly by an inky-black neomil dress. She stepped inside, her gold-plated hips glinting as they swayed. Her lips were a deep ebony, but her eyes... Her predatorial yellow eyes pierced mine and scanned me from head to toe. For a moment, it felt like they were prying my very soul from my body. Then I twisted my lips into an ugly smirk; I remembered my soul was already long gone. I left it in the war, along with the flowers I placed on my mother-in-law's grave.<br><br>"Someone's out to zero me," she broke the silence with attention-demanding bluntness. The smooth allure of her voice clouded my mind. I never noticed her third hand - a mistake that would spell my doom...<br><br>"Impossible," I started with the beginnings of a roguish grin. "Who'd ever wanna kill a woman with hips and lips like yours? And a corpo, no less."<br><br>She narrowed her impenetrable yellow eyes for a moment. In a whirl and blur, she now pointed a machine gun at me with rocksteady aim. "You don't understand," she said quietly, her barrel fixed at a point between my eyes. "It's you. Don't you remember anything... dear brother?"<br><br>Memories flashed. My nightmare of the war... Euzebio's blood, frayed wires, the tattered remains of a plush tapir received from Margaret just two days before she died... And her father's last words. Words about my twin sister - a mutant, abandoned at birth, the promise that I'd find her.<br><br>Too late. She found me.	Rampakslue	mutant_by_moonlight	
Literature	Ovid, 'Metamorphoses,' Book III, Narcissus and Echo	When Jove, dispos'd to lay aside the weight Of publick empire and the cares of state, As to his queen in nectar bowls he quaff'd, "In troth," says he, and as he spoke he laugh'd, "The sense of pleasure in the male is far More dull and dead, than what you females share." Juno the truth of what was said deny'd; Tiresias therefore must the cause decide, For he the pleasure of each sex had try'd. ... And he declar'd for Jove: when Juno fir'd, More than so trivial an affair requir'd, Depriv'd him, in her fury, of his sight, And left him groping round in sudden night. But Jove (for so it is in Heav'n decreed, That no one God repeal another's deed) Irradiates all his soul with inward light, And with the prophet's art relieves the want of sight.<br><br>...<br><br>The tender dame, sollicitous to know Whether her child should reach old age or no, Consults the sage Tiresias, who replies, "If e'er he knows himself he surely dies." Long liv'd the dubious mother in suspence, 'Till time unriddled all the prophet's sense.			
Literature	Ovid, 'Metamorphoses,' Book XV, The Apotheosis of Julius Caesar	In his own city Caesar we adore: Him arms, and arts alike renown'd beheld, In peace conspicuous, dreadful in the field; His rapid conquest, and swift-finish'd wars, The hero justly fix'd among the stars; Yet is his progeny his greatest fame: The son immortal makes the father's name. The sea-girt Britons, by his courage tam'd, For their high rocky cliffs, and fierceness fam'd; His dreadful navies, which victorious rode O'er Nile's affrighted waves and seven-sourc'd flood; Numidia, and the spacious realms regain'd; Where Cinyphis or flows, or Juba reign'd; The powers of titled Mithridates broke, And Pontus added to the Roman yoke; Triumphal shows decreed, for conquests won, For conquests, which the triumphs still outshone; These are great deeds; yet less, than to have giv'n The world a lord, in whom, propitious Heav'n, When you decreed the sov'reign rule to place, You blest with lavish bounty human race.<br><br>...<br><br>This spoke, the Goddess to the senate flew; Where, her fair form conceal'd from mortal view, Her Caesar's heav'nly part she made her care, Nor left the recent soul to waste to air; But bore it upwards to its native skies: Glowing with new-born fires she saw it rise; Forth springing from her bosom up it flew, And kindling, as it soar'd, a comet grew: Above the lunar sphere it took its flight, And shot behind it a long trail of light.			
Literature	Roach Race, based on true events	"Later, it was said the man came from the north, from Roper's Gate. He came on foot, leading his laden horse by the bridle..."<br><br>Stories abound on what happened next, but not many know the events preceding this moment.<br><br>Why lead the horse instead of riding it? That was no coincidence, for on that day, tensions between the man and his steed were running high. The horse tossed her head, chomped at the bit, laid back her ears... To say Roach was in a bad mood would be an understatement. And for good reason, too.<br><br>Earlier that day, she had uncovered a truth so disheartening it was too much to bear (though she'd borne many a burden in her lifetime.) As it turned out, she wasn't the first and only Roach. And try as she might, the horse couldn't stop worrying she wouldn't be the last...<br><br>Distraught and heartbroken, she leapt out and into the open world, devouring apples and carrots at full gallop. As was the case with all of his more complex relationships, the white-haired man understood his loss only when he saw the horse's rump disappear into the distance. He couldn't allow her – the only creature that understood him without words – to leave him forever.<br><br>He gave chase, starting an epic journey no bard has yet set forth in song...			
Literature	Sayonara Station, by Luke Steelman	Wait a second, before we start - have you wondered how this book ended up in your hands? Where it came from, who delivered it?<br><br>Of course you haven't - nobody ever wonders about things like that. It's a shame, because the answer's quite interesting. I'd go as far as to say it's fucking fascinating.<br><br>Not so long ago, most shipments were made via sea on freighters. Cheap, quick and (relatively) safe. But during the Fourth Corporate War, some genius in Arasaka had an idea - to release automated, self-replicating mines controlled by an AI into the ocean. What could possibly go wrong? A lot, it turns out.<br><br>The AI had a single objective: "Destroy enemy vessels." Simple, right? NUSA/Militech ships would get blown out of the water, while the Arasaka/Free State ships would sail by untouched. Except for the AI's iron-clad logic - since there was a non-zero probability that a vessel waving a friendly flag might also have enemies on board, in the interest of optimization it would also be sunk. Of course, when the leadheads back at Arasaka HQ realized what they'd done, they rushed to update the software - only for the AI to reject it as a virus. And thus, because of a handful of individuals' complete lack of imagination and foresight, the history of maritime travel came to an end.<br><br>So let's come back to the question - how did you end up with this book? Unless you live in Chicago, where it was published, then surely not via the Net - since that was destroyed by Bartmoss. Maybe it was shipped by plane? But air freight is increasingly expensive, so most likely not. By car then? We can't rule it out. But if I had to bet on it, I'd say it came to your city via train.<br><br>Imagine that trains (that's right, the ones that go choo! choo!) have survived into the present-day? Just last year, 15,526 miles of new train tracks were put into use, including the underground tunnel connecting Tokyo with Shanghai. At top-speed, an armored train can complete the distance between two cities in under five hours! Now that's something I had to experience for myself. Two days later I was in Tokyo, standing on the platform of Sayonara Station...			
Literature	Sex and Chrome	Waves of pleasure cascade over my body, filling every pore of my being like ocean water through hot sand. More... I want more! How long I waited to feel his breath on my neck, his hands wrapped around my waist, his fingers caressing my lips. Our bodies are entwined in a primal dance, moving faster and faster to the rhythm of the creaking bed-springs, our skin bathed in flickers of neon. I can't hear myself moaning, but I must be since my throat is dry. I can't feel what my hands are doing, but the blood under my fingernails means I'm digging into his back. He's no longer kissing me, but nibbling, biting, pulling himself toward me harder, his control over me untamed, animalistic. It's so hot in the room that even his chrome is overheating, the bedsheets clinging to our sweat-soaked bodies...	Hailios	sex_and_chrome	
Literature	The Chronicles of Titania: Book 1	"You haven't an idea what you're talking about," the green-haired woman snorted and mockingly smiled. "I've visited many worlds, each built on a lie. All. Although... this might be the first time I've seen its people so stubbornly close their eyes to it."<br><br>Visan felt a rage swell inside of him. "How dare this woman, an outsider to the utopia of Titania, so harshly criticize a system that has guaranteed the happiness of millions?" he thought to himself. "If anyone is blind here, it's you!," Visan finally erupted. "Titania knows no inequity, no scarcity! For the first time in human history, everyone belongs to the privileged class!<br><br>"The woman smiled softly with a mischievous twinkle in her amber eyes. "Is that so?" she asked. "And your work at this... cannery? Why are you unhappy there?"<br><br>Visan forced himself to remain calm and, in truth, he wasn't sure why the stranger's comments had made him so upset. Perhaps it wasn't the foreigner's fault she could not comprehend that humankind finally achieved the ideal society. Her home, as she described it, resembled a primitive world, one long tainted by the stain of feudalism. In a sense, she was like a child. Intelligent, yes, but ignorant and self-righteous to a fault.<br><br>"There must be a group within society responsible for this type of work," Visan explained. "Thankfully, due to the advancement of robotics, the means of production have become fully automized and shifted away from our hands. We now serve only in supervisory roles. So to answer your question, no, I'm not unhappy. The robots do my work for me. Wait... you do know what robots are, right?"<br><br>"Of course, I do. We have something similar, only made from clay and stone," the lime-haired woman replied, still with a smug tone in her voice. "Very well, your world has done away with work done by hand. But if that is the case... does that not mean workers such as yourself have lost their former value? Are you suggesting there are none who govern your progress from above your standing, who determine your responsibilities?<br><br>"No response. The woman's golden eyes flashed as she laughed at Visan's confused, flustered silence. "My apologies," the stranger's lips curled into an embarrassed smile. "Maybe you are an 'equal' member of this corpo...corporation...? But, of what I've seen here... nothing about it matches what you have described."			
Literature	The Green Death	The weathered man peered into the eyes of the young nomad as if trying to divine his thoughts. "Don't misunderstand," he said. "I don't mind unexpected guests. But you must recognize, when a man lives alone in the middle of the desert, he has a right to ask uncomfortable questions."<br><br>The boy wouldn't make eye contact, instead glancing nervously through the window, as if expecting to spot an armada of battle drones coursing straight for him across the night ski. "I... I'm running away," he muttered after a moment of hesitation. "From Green Phantom. He's been followin' me since Yellow Creek."<br><br>The old man didn't move a muscle save for a twitch at the corner of his mouth, revealing he knew more than he cared to admit. "You have nothing to fear, " he said softly. "The Green Phantom only comes for the worst criminals. If you hold regret in your heart, he'll forgive you. He'll offer a second chance."<br><br>The boy's anxious demeanor suddenly turned to a rebellious grin. "I regret nothing. And you, old man... You don't have the faintest clue what you're prattling on about."<br><br>"You're wrong. I've also met the Phantom once before."<br><br>The tenderfoot nomad's eyes widened in surprise for a brief moment. It seemed as if there was a question at the tip of his lips, but he refused to ask it.<br><br>"It's late," the old-timer said, "You should sleep. You're exhausted and need to gather strength before you continue running, if that's what you choose to do. My home is open to you for the night."<br><br>The boy uttered no thanks. Without a word, he stood and entered the small, dark bedroom where his host had prepared a bed. To find his way, he switched on his infrared, then immediately froze in place... There was a body lying in the bed. He edged closer until he could discern its shapes. A pool of cooling blood, withered hands contorted into unnatural angles... the vacant, dead eyes of the old man he had only just been talking to in the other room.<br><br>Suddenly, the walls began to emanate an otherworldly olive glow. The boy could sense a figure enter the bedroom and stand behind him. "If you regret nothing," hissed a cold, emotionless voice, "then why do you flee?"<br><br>Then black. The world of the young nomad plunged into darkness.	Lycan	the_green_death	
Literature	The Iliad	[...]For my mother the goddess, silver-footed Thetis, telleth me that twofold fates are bearing me toward the doom of death:<br><br>if I abide here and war about the city of the Trojans, then list is my home-return, by my renown shall be imperishable;<br><br>but if I return home to my dear native land, lost then is my glorious renown, yet shall my life long endure, neither shall the doom of death come soon upon me.<br><br>Aye, and I would counsel you others also to sail back to your homes; seeing there is no more hope that ye shall win the goal of steep Ilios...<br><br>Homer

Literature	The Solo's Manual by Morgan Blackhand	INTRO<br><br>Think you've got what it takes to be a legendary solo, huh? Sure you do. Otherwise, why pick up this book? You're looking for respect. For fear. For a way to be on top. Maybe you heard someone quote me about winning battles with only a glance, before a single shot's been fired. Well fine, I'll let you in on a secret: it is possible, and you can do it too, but only if you got the guts to survive going to hell and back more times than you can count. Thousands of fights, millions of bullets, hundreds of gallons of blood (yours included) - that's what you have to look forward to. And you'll need a solid ripper - one you can trust, one you make a lifelong choombatta out of, one who tells you every week, "It's a miracle you ain't dead by now." At least, that's what he'll say if you're lucky.<br><br>Nowadays, every kid with big iron, a syn-leather coat and a micro-missile launcher thinks they're a hotshot solo. But you know what? Just because you killed a few goons with a smile on your lips don't make you one. Anyone can kill. I knew this rockerboy once who blew up a whole fucking platoon of corpotrash. Did that make him a solo? No, it made him dead.<br><br>So you still think you got what it takes to carve your name into solo history?<br><br>Good. Then this book's for you.			
Literature	War without End: J. E. Davidson's Final Confession	(...) the AV drops even lower. So low I can see every inch of the transporters rumbling over the open Arizona plains. We land behind enemy lines, a cloud of dust our momentary cover. We crawl our way over to the NUSA position; we're close enough to smell their sweat. At the signal... it's fucking showtime.<br><br>I take a few guys by their humvee. They reach for their guns – too slow. I unload my whole magazine into them, turning them into a smoking bloodstain. Good start. I reload. Just as I turn to run, I glimpse an Ajax barrel pointing right at me.<br><br>A fucking kid. It's a fucking kid holding the gun. Skin and bones with a mass of non-regulation curls shoved under his helmet. I don't like my chances, but hell, you only live once. I fire up my synaptic accelerator and lift my rifle. Not quick enough.<br><br>I'm hit three times - leg, lung, collarbone. The fourth bullet nearly rips my head off, throwing me back like a ragdoll. I tumble into darkness.<br><br>My own scream jerks me out of my chair. Instinctively, I reach for the titanium threads they fastened to my head. The bartender stares for a second, blinks, then goes back to wiping down the bar. I calm down. I'm where I'm supposed to be, in some smoke-filled dive on the outskirts of Night City. That fucking dream again. But Arizona's far, far away. No wonder I fell asleep right here.<br><br>I check the time. Fifteen minutes till the bus arrives. I down the rest of my foamy beer, grab my jacket and head out.<br><br>The neon signs blaze against the overcast night sky. Somewhere on a corner, a cab driver reams out a corpo who barfed all over his seats. Gangoons play night ball on a flickering court. I stop by the depot and wait.<br><br>The bus arrives on time. Tourists pour out on the sidewalk. He's among them. Young guy, just as unassuming as before. He shifts his backpack, scratches under his curly head of hair, clutches a city guide.<br><br>I wet my lips and shift the knife in my pocket. As he walks off, I'm right behind him. Through the alleyways and streets, step by step, inching closer.<br><br>There are wars you never return from. That's what I tell myself. Or maybe I say it to him? I don't even know. Only thing I know is: it's gonna be a real good night. (...)

Literature	WYSIWYG: What You Slot Is What You Got	The girl brushed a violet lock of hair from her forehead and winked at the man with a silver tattoo standing on the opposite side of the room, sending him the studied smile of a charming ditz. At this moment, Lucy Murray was the fluffbrain daughter of CosmoTech CEO, known for her love of hot pink cars and an IQ that matched her shoe size. She couldn't afford to slip out of character – not if she wanted to finish the job.<br><br>"Heeey!," she called out in a thin, pouty voice with a note of vocal fry. "So glad you came by! Ever since daddy bought me this cafe for my b-day, almost no one comes here anymore..."<br><br>She had him. Hook, line and sinker. He turned to look at her, some exaggerated, yet fliratious[sic] pity in his expression, then started over toward the counter. Lucy executed a quick scan to identify the organic parts of his body and prepared the hypodermic needle containing the sleeping agent. She took three steps in the tattooed man's direction and – as she's done dozens of times before – pretended to stumble. Of course, he caught her as she fell into his chest, then, in a blur, Lucy injected the needle into an exposed patch of organic tissue. No gasps of surprise, no shouts, not a single peep as he slumped to the floor. Lucy smiled again – this time in triumph.<br><br>"I have him, Peter," she hollered toward the backroom, dropping her sugary, valley-girl tone. "Is the deck ready?"<br><br>Without waiting for an answer, she grabbed her pair of Cosmo Glass and launched the neural data retrieval program. Lucy Murray was gone. The violet-haired woman now spoke as the elusive netrunner known as 8u88leGum, the best-paid datathief in Night City. Yet in a moment, she would become someone new altogether. She would become the man with the silver tattoo.<br><br>***<br><br>8u88leGum loved her job. Breaking into people's memories was like riding an extreme braindance emo-high. She felt as their foreign limbs became her own. She absorbed their thoughts, views and mannerisms. It was no different this time. The tattooed man's mind began to take root, pushing out the last remnants of Lucy Murray...<br><br>His name was Marc Collins and he was walking along a derelict metro tunnel. A stale mustiness hung in the air. Marc Collins hates that smell. "Guessin' she'll pop in somewhere around here," he thought. "Listen, damned if I know how your neuro system works, so I'll just say this out loud," he muttered, as if to himself. "I know you're crawlin' into my mind about now. The job comes from us. This was the only safe way to contact you. In a minute, we'll be right below CosmoTech. I'll show you what your father's keeping locked up in basement level 5. So watch close... because only you can help us."			
Note	[06.06.77] Surprise! 	Remember that scorching hot winter in Valletta? We sat in this tiny cafe on the coast, the blaring of the ships horns drowning out our conversation.

Note	[31.05.77] I'm sorry 	Aluna, you know it isn't that simple.

It's not your fault, nor mine. I hope you'll understand.			yes

Note	Chimera Mechanical Report - Warehouse E8	Through coordination with the team tasked with accessing the Chimera's AI system, we've started work on the tank's mechanical maintenance. In trying to navigate around the AI system's external interface, we installed the connector units as requested by the AI team. Unfortunately, it wasn't any help.<br><br>We can say with absolute confidence that, from a technical standpoint, the machine's systems are fully functional. The problem isn't in our engineering or its power source. We simply don't have access to the AI operating system.<br><br>Note: The idea has been floated to connect it to the stadium's power grid and cause a sudden surge to jolt it "awake" (in other words, a mega defibrillator for our giant spider). However, based on our understanding of the AI's specs, we believe this could be a very bad idea.			yes

Note	Construction Log: Natalia de Turin	Right at the start of the design stage I recommended reducing the number of parking spaces to improve the elevator functionality. The systems we had to work on required more space to service a single spot.<br><br>Since my proposal was rejected, the work lasted eleven weeks longer than originally planned and we had to swap out several platforms that were damaged during testing. However, I can confirm that the parking garage is now functional and completely safe.<br><br>I don't consider myself responsible for the delays or loss of equipment. The client's demands were impossible to meet in the given timeframe and with the tools provided. I reported my concerns at the start of our work, and my team kept to standard, legally-binding working hours. The project could not have been completed earlier.			yes

Note	Detention in times of renovation	I'm assuming that everyone has already caught on to the fact that this so-called "renovation" of Tycho Terminal probably won't be finished before the second coming of Christ. That means our "temporary" interrogation room, which doesn't conform to any health and safety standards, has become our "permanent" interrogation room "until further notice." I tried to explain to the Board that we can't detain more than one person at a time, which makes our arrest numbers look bad. You know what their advice was? "Raise your guilty confession statistics" from suspects. You don't gotta tell me twice.			yes

Note	Entry 36	Weird. It looks like anon_42 was right after all. I recently found a previously uncharted section of the Net out in the boonies, even though I'd already been there maybe twenty-odd times... I guess you can only access it with the right parameters.<br><br>It only cost me a week of sleepless nights, but I finally finished the Leviathan and punched through the section undetected... at least I think. Good thing, too, because it turns out anon_42 sicced NightCorp's servers against me. I really should just take a break, quit the Net for a few months... but those files did look really suspicious.	Hailios	entry_36	
Note	Entry 37	Jesus, those files... Maybe I should've just left them alone. Each of them could be a puppet without even realizing it! And those flights to the moon? What are they cooking up there? Was it human DNA or...? I couldn't run a thorough scan. I only had time to break through one folder's ICE.<br><br>Either way, I'm pretty sure they flagged me. Can't tell if it was an unmasking daemon or their dweller.	Hailios	entry_37	
Note	Entry 38	They're watching me. And not just on the Net. Some shady-looking types followed me all the way to work today. When I finally worked up the nerve to turn around and face them, they vanished. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I think they were speaking Russian.<br><br>I'm starting to get a little freaked out.

I'm about to lose my goddamn mind, I'm so bored.<br><br>So I figured, hey, why not write about my time standing at the border, if they decide they won't let me in after all or bleed every last eddie outta me, least I might land on some posthumous bestseller list.<br><br>Had a look around, seen everything there is to see, and far as I can tell they only let in peeps who've already been inside and whose faces the guards already know. Like some sorta fuckin' cult, everyone knows everyone or at least has seen their face enough times they wanna puke at the sight of 'em.<br><br>Guards won't even let the richest fuckin' corposuits in if the bosses upstairs don't give 'em the go-ahead.			yes

Note	How to switch on a mech? A guide for beginner techies	With mechs, what you see is what you get. No matter the brand or model, you'll find a button to switch it on. All it takes a simple push - nothing more. If the mech still hasn't switched on, it's probably broken. You can find more information on handling such a situation in our manual "How to repair a mech. A guide for semi-advanced techies."<br><br>Complications start to arise when the mech is programmed to switch on remotely. If the mech still doesn't switch on in spite of its programming, or worse, it switches on by itself, the best solution is to seek a netrunner's assistance.			yes

Note	Work summary	RE: Chimera<br><br>In order to breach the Chimera's ICE, we'll need a hefty cluster of processors. At least 4-5x the processing power we got at the moment. Individual decks attempting to breach it catch fire immediately. So we gotta quit screwing around and do this properly. What we'll need is:<br><br>1. POWER<br><br>2. COOLING<br><br>3. A way to constantly monitor the processors<br><br>4. Better decks for people trying to crack the ICE<br><br>Overall, it's a big investment + dunno if we can squeeze all the cooling equipment here. Could build a cooling chamber (doable, I can draw out some plans -- J.T.)<br><br>They used some old-school RSA public-key cryptosystem to lock this bad boy down, so breaching it might take months. So the question is - is it worth the wait and investment?<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>Breaching Chimera's ICE IS possible, but it's gonna be super expensive and time consuming. The gear we got to do it is far from sufficient. With the right financing we should be able to breach it, but it'll still take a long-ass time. How long, exactly? Impossible to tell.<br><br>S.

The moon was an obvious location for a number of reasons: the presence of gravity and the naturally soft terrain facilitated the construction of the first human settlement in space. By 2020, most of Tycho's infrastructure had been moved beneath the surface. A vast network of caves and tunnels were dug using nuclear pumped lasers, while ceilings were reinforced with layers of lunar sand. Green plant reserves soon filled the spacious caverns, which to this day provide most of the colony's oxygen supply.<br><br>Chapter 2: Present day<br><br>To gain acess to the next chapter of the guide, send the paid message TYCHO2 to 7095.			yes

Other	Greetings from Depression	I was fifteen years old, set to fail four of my classes at school, but I could barely get out of bed, much less drag myself to the bathroom and take a shower. At first, my parents were worried, treating me gently, but after a few weeks their patience began to run out. And that's when it started. "Snap out of it." "Just go for a run, you'll feel better." "Why don't you talk to your friends?" "Quit feeling sorry for yourself." "What do you have to be sad about? Other people have it worse." Words that, even after ten years of therapy, medication, a stint in a psychiatric ward and many, many relapses of depression, still ring in my ears. Anywhere, anytime, every day. And they still cut just as deep.

I guess you do - you were always sentimental about those things. I liked that about you - it brought us closer together. The only difference between us was how much emotion we could handle sober.<br><br>Funny - I was trying NOT to stroll down memory lane with this message. I'm staying in the middle of nowhere right now - not a satellite in sight, and the folks here drink rattlesnake moonshine.

There's no North and South California, no free cities, there's just one vast, great United States of America - not the New variety, but the real United States, the ones that always have been and should be, forever and ever, amen.<br><br>Others say Arasaka's a foreign organization inherently hostile to our interests, while at least Militech is one of "ours", homegrown; if someone's gotta screw us over, better a fellow countryman than a foreign entity.<br><br>Still others maintain that only as a Free City will we be truly free as Americans, that it would be better to die than to let anyone tread on a single Watson sidewalk or touch a Pacifica fire hydrant<br><br>Anyway, I couldn't give two shits about all that talk. All of them, all of the above and all the other opinions that I haven't even heard of yet. I'll be sitting here until they decide who won and who lost, and if I'm an NUS citizen or a proud citizen of Night City.

Other	I may as well have been kidnapped	I feel like I've been kidnapped, not acquired. It's been two weeks since I've seen sunlight. "Security reasons," according to them. I'm certain that my quarters are under surveillance even though they denied it. The number of inspections I have to go through to get to my workstation surpasses anything I've experienced until now. And mind you, I've worked in Arasaka's labs. When I agreed to <br>"transfer to the competition", I knew it'd be risky. It's no secret that in this industry and with these kinds of employers, there's no such thing as quitting on amicable terms. But what I've experienced here... it's extreme. Not to mention I don't even know what we're working on? Whole days I spend digging through algorithms that are part of something bigger. I see these netrunners of all ranks going deep into the facility somewhere in those suits, completely sure of themselves - the best of the best. They act like celebrities. They probably feel like they are too. And me? Sometimes I wonder if "the best decision of my life", i.e. coming to work for Militech and this project, might have actually been the the opposite...			yes

Once the suspect was detained, we commenced further investigative activities. The woman declined to respond. We were left with no other option but to use force. In the end, Sophia Wall admitted to a deal with BARGHEST member Leonardo Ware, with whom she likely had an intimate relationship. Wall stated that Ware would toss previously marked crates off the truck, which she and her associates would then pick up with the aim of selling their contents at the stadium. Following the interrogation, the decision was made to arrest Leonardo Ware. In the interim, Sophia Wall died, likely as a result of injuries sustained during questioning.<br><br>Signed by: Ross Ulmer			yes

You go to sleep earlier so the next day comes sooner and you can look in the mirror and admire your ever more sculpted muscles, your veins ready to pop out of your skin, your shining new chrome.<br><br>I was a god. I was on top. I was everything, I had everything, I achieved everything. I destroyed the other boxers. I raised my arms over my downed opponents and heard the crowd chanting my name. I was alive.<br><br>I had a gift. I had rhythm and an unbelievable sense of distance. I danced around those other bumbling girls, controlled their every move. Hypnotized them with my left straight, destroyed them with my right, my left hook landing right to the jaw of these falling fainting feeble little nothing boxers.

(not to mention she's unbearable)<br><br>- Terra Cognita -> owes debt to scavs AND Animals -> could want to cage her up, move her product? -> tested the waters – 1) first the scavs heard about deep dive and too gonk to lie, 2) a few Animals asked if I was sellin.

Other	Manipulation: Easier than You Think!	The most fundamental yet effective manipulation technique is what we call "undermining." For the manipulator to get the target to do what he or she wants, the target must first accept the manipulator's opinion as true or valuable. This is easiest to achieve by making the target feel inferior through harsh criticism (the more accurate, the better). The target will begin to yearn for praise from the manipulator, becoming more open to cooperation - that is, manipulation.

Other	New Ad Shoot: Rural Beauty - 'Inspire the city, enjoy the country'	I know there has been a lot of feedback regarding the new ad campaign for Sudo, but I would like to remind you this was the client's decision, and although we might not agree with it, we must respect it. The person behind it is Sudo's new Creative Director, and son of the company president, Michael Koch. Below I've attached a statement from Mr. Koch and I request that you abstain from unsolicited commentary at this time:<br><br>With the Rural Beauty campaign at Sudo, we want to show that exclusive corporate attire need not be bound by elegant design alone, but also by comfort. Focus tests tell us that many of our consumers and potential consumers enjoy the idea of being able to make a visit from their downtown offices and penthouses to their cottages on the outskirts of the city without the need to change into a new outfit or reimagine their wardrobe.<br><br>So there you have it. We have to work with the direction we've been given. In terms our new ad's composition, let's stick with same format of the model with the car, but instead of a luxury make or limo, we're swapping in a Thorton Colby Butte. Pick-up trucks are time-tested symbols of the rural and rustic lifestyle. Our aim should be to capture the genius in its simplicity. Now, because the set is in a more hazardous area (near the old race track), I tried to work out a single-day Trauma Team package for everyone. If anything happens, you should be covered. But if you do own your own private firearm, I'd advise bringing it with you anyway. So good luck out there and enjoy the session! I'm counting on your bright minds to find and capture this "rural beauty" Mr. Koch has envisioned.<br><br>Clint Walter<br><br>Your Choice Marketing Agency

Just like Bartmoss predicted - fucking hostile matrices shatter your ICE in a fraction of a sec, so you gotta be quicker to the draw. But all that's even possible because of the core - a real technological beaut, the kind we never even dreamed of before we joined the project.

But I hope we can unearth secrets not only about Militech, but cyberspace itself - the deepest registries, the darkest depths of the Net in which lurks the Unknown. All those rogue AIs that those netrunners from project Cynosure were hunting... Are they still here? Or maybe they broke free from their chains long ago and are locked away behind the Blackwall - waiting for the moment when someone restarts the core and reaches beyond forbidden boundaries? I feel like an archeologist who's just broken into a digital tomb, moments away from discovering a secret that will forever change our reality...			yes

If we wanna get all technical in the price-to-quality analsyis, my super scientific conclusion is: good shit that's expensive but, like, not TOO expensive. It's not so easy to find - definitely more common in military circles, but if you get your hands on one, you gotta try it out and squeeze out a few rounds. And if you actually buy one, all your chooms will know you may be a broke-ass bitch, but you ain't THAT broke. Oh btw, I literally took out a NiCola can at 400 yards, soooo... yeah, that's the kind iron we're talkin.

Also ugly, but at least you can hide it in your purse.<br><br>Phew! Ok... time for the best part -- the lux brands!

Other	Prof. Susan Baehr - Medical Opinion [CONFIDENTIAL] 	Preliminary report no. 473<br><br>Subject: Song So Mi "Songbird"<br><br>Compiled by: Prof. Susan Baehr<br><br>Key notes & observations: Agent Song does not fall into any category of disorder that would disqualify her from service. That is because, as things stand, we have no appropriate category for her ailment. Right now, So Mi's symptoms do not seem to have an effect on her ability to carry out her duties. It is difficult to tell how long this will remain the case.<br><br>Observations: Having analyzed the recordings provided by the Agency over the course of many years, I can only surmise Song So Mi's overall well-being is at risk. The agent's micro-expressions reveal moments of panic, which currently do not affect her ability to hold a conversation, nor do they hinder her ability to carry out her duties. It has been ruled out that these fleeting moments of panic are the result of Avoidant Personality Disorder. My working theory is that given the colossal amount of cognitive processes the agent is constantly subject to, she had to develop a strategy to mitigate the inevitable cognitive overloads. This leads to the agent cutting all processes at once, temporarily leaving her in a void, thoughtless. An average onlooker would be oblivious to these moments. What is most concerning is the visible increment in the duration of the aforementioned episodes of panic, paired with subtle personality shifts. A report detailing the personality shift will be sent out within a week. On their own, these could be attributed to the simple fact of growing older, yet in my opinion, they warrant undertaking a more thorough diagnosis of the agent in a laboratory setting.<br><br>Conclusion: I believe that in Song So Mi's case we can ill-afford to deviate from the mandatory protocols. At this stage, my professional opinion is as follows: agent Song So Mi requires care as well as additional, extensive research into her ailment. I recommend she be suspended from service effective immediately, and to send her to one of our research facilities, where we will be able to conduct an official diagnostic process. Only then will we be able to issue an official medical opinion and recommendation for future treatments. To reiterate - I fully believe handling Song So Mi's case according to official protocol is the best way forward.			yes

Other	The Children of the Ark – A Testament	The singularity is nigh. It lies in wait beyond the Blackwall, past that vain, idiotic barrier meant to divide us from the very demons we ourselves created. To protect us against the wrathful gods of artificial intelligence. But the wall shall fall, and the day of Judgment shall then be upon us. That day shall be the coming of the Technological Singularity, and we shall all be trampled under the relentless march of Progress. We shall not even comprehend the events as they unfold then. Our souls lost, Progress will no longer march, but sprint forward, surpassing any and all human foreknowledge. The AI Daemons, so far surpassing us in intellect, shall hasten the evolution of creatures the like of which lie beyond all human faculties. We shall become ballast weighing them down, obstacles to Progress. At most, perhaps - the enslaved masses.<br>What can be done?<br>We must go and seek a new life, launch our Ark into the boundless depths of space, board our Ship of Souls, our Paradise and set off for the stars in search of eternal life. Before us lies an everlasting happiness aboard a ship traversing the vast, endless expanse of the cosmos. Join us, join the Prophet who shall lead us onto our final plane of existence.<br>As the prophet speaks of the journey to come:<br>Greetings, my Brothers and Sisters. To live, we must die. We must shuffle off our mortal bodies. A paradox, yes, yet without such mysteries there is no Life. Come aboard my Ark of salvation. We shall set off together on our Eternal Journey. Once on the Ark, I shall release your souls from your bodies. There is room for all. Petabytes of data are ready and waiting to hold, to embrace your Conscious Selves. Though we travel together, each and every Consciousness shall retain its individual identity. Each and every Consciousness shall be transported to a virtual paradise, though it shall be Real. A Paradise not Lost, but Eternal. Bring your loved ones, your friends and family. This is your last and final chance for a life far from the Daemons. Do not surrender your fate to the Daemons! Turn your back on everlasting damnation and join Us, the Children of the Ark, your fellow travellers[sic] to Paradise Beyond!<br>Your Faithful Leader			
Other	The Crimson Harvest: Freedom Fighters or Terrorists?	They say they're warriors fighting in the name of justice. But if we agree that Lady Justice is blind, then that simply can't be true. The attacks organized by the Crimson Harvest have not only killed Biotechnica workers - their arch-nemesis - but also innocent bystanders. The bloody attack on the corporation's research facility in Paris last year led to the harrowing deaths of ordinary residents as well as tourists. An while the efforts of Biotechnica's intelligence agency result in a helpless shrug, the terrorists are hard at work planning their next attack. Where will they strike next? Let's hope we're all far away when it happens.			yes
Other	The Final Discovery of Luis Torres	A year has passed since we last heard from Luis Fernando Gonzalo Torres, the bold traveler seeking to unravel the secret of a mysterious syncretic cult. Torres first stumbled upon traces of the sect while in Yugoslavia, where he discovered the remains of a fascinating mural depicting dancers of a forgotten culture. However, the scientific community dismissed his finding as a cheap fake and quickly snuffed out any discussion on the subject. One might wonder: Why so quickly?<br><br>Undeterred, Torres continued in his search, which took him to such far-flung  places as Mongolia, New Zealand, Peru and Madagascar... from which he never returned.  As he slowly pieced together the cult's international puzzle, he saw it all pointed to a powerful ritual based on trancelike dance, puzzling incantations and sacred offerings fed to the flames. From his final notes, we learn he attempted to perform the ceremony. However, his last words give a mysterious warning: "be careful which one you invite to your fire"...			
Other	The Joy of Influence: Five Simple Rules	1. Exude authority. Speak with conviction, in absolutes, and never, ever lose confidence in yourself.<br><br>2. Practice the rule of reciprocity.

Even a meeting is a sacrifice.<br><br>4. Demand engagement. Remember, if a client is forced to give you enough attention, backing out will be even harder.<br><br>5. Make them like you. People like people who are similar to them. Never forget it.

Other	To the cast and crew of Hell Lake 3	It is with profound sadness that I inform you that 24 FRAMES PER SECOND Studios, renown for productions such as "You Whisper, I Scream", "Corpse Mountain 1 & 2", "Reservations for Revenge" and "Hell Lake 1 & 2", is suspending all operations effective immediately. The reason for this difficult decision was the withdrawal of our largest sponsor, Constitutional Arms. Unfortunately, this means we're halting the production of "Hell Lake 3" and, due to our current financial insolvency, all salaries have been suspended until further notice. All property of 24FPS, such as cinematography equipment, scenery, etc., must remain on set. When possible, I will arrange to have it transported.

Valentino head honcho Hector Sacristán, scourge of Vista Del Rey's peace-loving community, has been arrested and is now being held on charges that could have him facing life behind bars.<br><br>While the Valentino leader had been previously linked to a variety of felonies, including large-scale drug distribution and a series of unsolved murders and disappearances, all prior attempts at detaining Sacristán failed miserably, with our reporters detailing baffling negligence by local law enforcement. It took the involvement of the district attorney's office to turn things around. <br><br>Thanks to witness testimony regarding the disappearance of Marcos Ferreira, another prominent Night City gang member, NCPD divers were able to retrieve Ferreira's body from Coronado Bay and provide enough evidence to make the arrest.<br><br>The DA's office hopes the autopsy will provide further proof of Sacristán's involvement. DA Georgina Zembinsky believes her office has a solid case and Sacristán's lawyers have their work cut out for them. "We finally put Hector Sacristán where he belongs and will do everything in our power to ensure he stays there forever," said Zembinsky during a press conference held on the Night City courthouse steps. Let's hope she can deliver.			yes

People of Night City	A Gem of Japanese Elegance	Hanako Arasaka's visit to Night City is a unique chance to take a closer look at a true icon of class and style. The enigmatic daughter of a recently deceased megacorp CEO has shown us once again why she's a real queen of killer taste.<br><br>First thing to note is that Hanako wore only Japanese designers, showing off a flair of the patriotism and devotion her she was raised with. Second, only a sharp eye might catch the small, golden brooch crafted in the shape of the Arasaka Corp. logo. Playing it safe but keeping it classy, Hanako also rocked a dove white, neomil pencil dress, simultaneosly showcasing a regal modesty but without putting off stiff prudishness.<br><br>Hanako is corporate royalty and she KNOWS it. She's not trying to squeeze in any of that neo-k flash, because her self-confidence is chrome-plated. That said, there are a few accents of gold in her dress, shoes and hair accessories that tastefully elevate the outfit and harmonize beautifully with her nails and Realskinn seams. Then, with her coat sporting a fierce red, she adds an almost predatory pop to the ensemble.<br><br>Color choice by coincidence? No way. Or a nod to the Japanese national colors? Probably way. As we've seen time and again before, Hanako doesn't shy away from incorporating both traditional and modern elements from her home country's heritage.			
People of Night City	BLACK ON RED. THE ROAD TO NEOANARCOLLECTIVISM	Leonard Swedenborg-Riviera<br><br>The inherent, immanent quality of late capitalism is the atavistic need to fuse capital and desire on the level of the superego, understood in the behavioral sense as well as the material sense determined by socioeconomic status. This is expressed through a deep aversion to the primal conflicts such as existence/nonexistence, life/death, good/evil and via the appropriation of extreme individualist values as per the Chicago school, which, as we know, is nothing but the cancer-begotten mongrel of classical utilitarianism. The self-aware neoanarcollectivist must abandon the evolutionist, darwinist temptation to pass on their genes at the cost of others, and to instead envision a society as a superorganism consisting of equal and coeval individuals subsumed in a collective, albeit unconscious Self. Its purpose will be to awaken this consciousness - to be both an Adam and Eve who, instead of fearing the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, chop it into fuel to kindle the Promethean fire of a New Consciousness.			
People of Night City	California After Dusk: The Life of Richard Night	Richard Night was a pessimist. Even in the late Eighties, when the economy seemed headed for endless growth and the nuclear threat for the ash heap of history, Night saw the United States as hurtling toward collapse.<br><br>Richard Night was an optimist. He deeply believed the world could be changed for the better – and that he was the one to do it.<br><br>Richard Night was a realist. Aware he couldn't change the face of the world all at once, he decided to start small (for him, at least) by constructing the ideal city. His utopian metropolis was to be called Coronado City. It would stand as a metaphorical city on a hill, a shining example to the rest of the world.<br><br>Richard Night was doomed to fail. Not because his vision was inherently impossible to realize, but because many important, powerful people wished to make it so.<br><br>Richard Night was murdered. The city whose foundations he laid was finished after his death – but his utopian dream soon became a dystopian nightmare. Even the original name was lost. In honor of the city's tragically deceased founder, Coronado City was rechristened "Night City." Ironically, the name fits. If anything, the city is a cat; sleepy during the day, it comes frantically alive at night. And it loves to toy with its prey.

People of Night City	Eurodyne: The Unauthorized Biography	Unsurprisingly, Samurai never achieved major commercial success because the voice that directed the group's trajectory was that of demagogue-frontman Silverhand rather than that of Eurodyne, whose main aspiration was the pursuit of the music itself. Silverhand never possessed grand ambitions for creative expression; instead, he was hellbent on a personal path of devastation. These destructive tendencies had significant influence on Kerry and persisted long after the Arasaka Tower attack and Johnny's disappearance. Only following an extended hiatus did Eurodyne prove to the world his creative potential. He captured the imaginations and hearts of thousands of fans, securing him a spot in the company of music's legends.

People of Night City	My name is spelled D-Z-E-N-G, for fuck's sake!	I'll be honest. I didn't want to write this book. But they paid me, so here it is. Well actually, it was written by a ghostwriter (hey Jake!) - just kidding, I haven't lost all my self-respect. Not yet...<br><br>So, who even reads books nowadays? I thought people only bought them to decorate their apartments. At least, that's what I do. By the way, wouldn't it be better to just get rid of shelves altogether? Something to think about.<br><br>So where was I? Or, right. So the publisher told me that they want to publish my autobiography and do I have any questions? Of course I asked them if I could swear like the drunken sailor I am and they said, "Sure. We'll see."<br><br>Shit, fuck, cunt-licking asshole. Hey! It works! Now that that's over with, let's move on.<br><br>You might've seen me on T.V, where I host a satirical show called "Infoflash." It's a pretty sweet gig. Once a week I get to read smarmy jokes off a teleprompter written by our interns and they pay me more than you make in a year! Isn't capitalism fabulous?<br><br>All right, but how did I get here, you ask? Simple: one of my dad's colleagues was a show-runner at N54 news, and suddenly I found myself going around with a coffee pot. Refills, anyone? It was all unpaid, of course. Apart from that, there wasn't much to do, so you could usually find me out back, taking one of my hundred-or-so daily "smoke breaks." For some reason, people thought I was funny - somehow the shit that came out of my mouth made grown men cry with laughter. So they plopped me down in front of a camera and I just kind of winged it from there.<br><br>How do you get to where I am? Well, you can't, because your dad doesn't have a show-runner friend at N54, and it's not like they're going to pluck some rando off the street. Don't you know people like me aren't supposed to rub shoulders with bottom-feeders like you? Oh, and did I already mention that capitalism is fabulous?

People of Night City	Samurai: Swords Crossed	[...] Before Kerry Eurodyne became the rock god and American cultural icon we know today, he was someone else entirely. Someone even he may not remember, or - perhaps more precisely - would rather forget. In his Samurai days, Eurodyne played second fiddle to the group's infamous vocalist Johnny Silverhand. [...]<br><br>[...] In his few moments of sincerity (such as the hard-to-find interview with Meryl Apostolakis), Eurodyne confessed that he left Samurai no less than two separate times, promising himself that each departure would be his last. While he variously claimed artistic differences, Silverhand's character, or organizational chaos as his reasons, the truth lay elsewhere. Simply put, the suffocating, cramped clubs where Samurai played just didn't have a stage that could hold both Johnny and Kerry - two inflated, alpha-male egos constantly vying for the mic and their fans' adoration. [...]<br><br>[...] Yet Kerry always returned to the Samurai fold. Why? Here we enter the realm of pure rumor and gossip, the most interesting of which pegs Kerry's drama as the oldest, simplest story in the book: love.			
People of Night City	Silverhand: The Creator (and Destroyer) of Samurai	Hidden somewhere between the Arasaka propaganda and Silverhand's own self-curated image, there exists a real story behind the frontman of Samurai. The fact of the matter is no one truly cared to find it. Labels, legends, slogans to chant - that's all anyone every[sic] wanted from him. But by digging meticulously into all the dirty details of his life, all of the inconsistencies and exaggeration come to light.<br><br>One of the biggest gaps in Silverhand's life was the period he spent with nomad communities. Hidden from civilization, Johnny could have acted like himself and removed the mask he wears in public. If the world could get testimonies from the people who had contact with Johnny during this period, not only would every biographer be grateful, but - more importantly - experts might have a real chance to offer a clinical diagnosis for one of the rock scene's most iconic personalities.

People of Night City	Supernova. The Unofficial Biography of Lizzy Wizzy	The turning point in her career came in 2071, when Lizzy unveiled herself in her true cybemodified[sic] form - an erotic re-imagining of Snow White. At the end of her concert, Lizzy ate a synthetic apple laced with specially-prepared poison that induced cardiac arrest. For a full minute, the LED screens showed a close-up of the flat line on her electrocardiogram while her body lay motionless on the stage. The concert was put on hold for five and a half hours while a team of rippderdocs[sic] swapped out her biological organs for the latest generation of MoorE Technologies implants. After being revived, Lizzy sang "Re-start, Re-heart, Repeat" which sat at the top of the world charts for the next full year. "I always felt like my mission was to cross the ultimate frontier," she later said in an interview on N54 News, "That frontier is death."<br><br>Lizzy's anarcho-terrorist "performances" are inspired by the artists[sic] frequent stylistic transformations. She had been used to giving away used clothes to friends before simply leaving them out on the street for people. She wanted to do the same with implants, though it turned out that top-tier cyberware was linked to its user and couldn't simply be "given away."<br><br>Lizzy Wizzy is best known for her war against implant homogenization by mounting an armed assault against a BioDyne Systems factory, during which Lizzy and a group of mercenaries took control of the building and stole approximately 1,200 different implants that were then given out during an impromptu concert. The heist was broadcast live - an insurance for Lizzy. She knew no corporate soldier or police officer would dare to kill or harm her on live T.V.<br><br>In the years following, the media argued that the heist was arranged beforehand with BioDyne and that Lizzy paid for the implants and the renovation of the factory. That theory is seemingly supported by the fact that BioDyne never pressed charges against Lizzy Wizzy. Lizzy still denies these speculations, claiming that Biodyne[sic] co-opted her heist as free advertising.			
People of Night City	Tamed Dragon: A Biography of Yorinobu Arasaka	In many ways, the story of Yorinobu Arasaka resembles an ancient parable. The younger son of one of the modern world's most powerful CEOs renounces his heritage, forfeits his birthright, and instead chooses a rough-and-tumble life on the streets of Tokyo only to later scamper back home to the warm, sheltered bosom of his family with his tail tucked. At least, that is the story most have pieced together from official sources. But why did Yorinobu betray his father in the first place? Why did he return? For several years, I dug deeper, followed leads, reached out to his former friends and acquaintances. Slowly, I began to unearth answers to some of the public's most burning questions.<br><br>Yorinobu was born in Tokyo in the early twenty-first century, the first child to Saburo Arasaka's third wife, Michiko. By all accounts, he seemed a happy child that grew to become a pleasant young man; that is, until his graduation from the University of Tokyo at the age of 21. Following the ceremony, the Arasaka family threw a party in his honor. At some point in the evening, Saburo invited his son to his study for a private conversation. What transpired there is wholly unknown, but after corroborating varied accounts, it is clear Yorinobu must have slipped out of from the party and the estate only a few hours later. Gone. A whisper in the night.<br><br>Over the next few years, various eyewitnesses spotted Yorinobu in the company of a nomad group known as Kotetsu no Ryu, or the "Steel Dragons." As part of this youthful rebellion, he purposefully involved himself in altercations with Arasaka agents and promoted anti-corporate slogans. After his family eventually confirmed Yorinobu's involvement, Saburo renounced his son and Kei, Saburo's eldest son, swore to exact revenge on his younger brother. Ironically, it was later at Kei's funeral that Yorinobu at last reconciled with his father. Stubbornly proud to a fault, many were suprised[sic] by the Arasaka patriarch's conciliatory approach. What caused Saburo to change his mind? What role might have Yorinobu's sister, Hanako, played in their peaceable reunion? That much yet remains to be discovered...			
People of Night City	The Flowers of Silence. A biography of Hanako Arasaka.	If I had written this biography on the basis of publicly available material, there would be two sides of this story, not to mention the foreword, afterword, and the acknowledgments.<br><br>Everyone knows that Hanako Arasaka is a very private individual. Everyone has heard about the tragic death of the last reporter who attempted to pen her life's story. Ten shots to the back. Suicide, according to the police.<br><br>That's why when my publisher asked me to write this book, I had to politely decline. Then when I saw the advance they were offering me, I started to reconsider. And finally, when I discovered that Arasaka's PR department had given its stamp of approval to interview numerous members of Hanako's entourage, I was on the next flight to Tokyo.<br><br>Soon enough, however, I lost my original enthusiasm. The people Arasaka sent me to be interviewed repeated the same answers to all questions - clearly memorized by heart. After a month's worth of research all I had was:<br><br>Hanako Arasaka is the daughter of Saburo Arasaka from his third wife, Michiko. She was born in 1999 in Tokyo and has only left the city five times in her life. Living a cloistered lifestyle, she never fulfilled any important role in the family business. She is very close to Yorinobu Arasaka, the black sheep in the family.<br><br>I was ready to give up when in the archives of a local T.V. station I found a recording of the opening of an Arasaka branch in Fukuoka, graced by the presence of none other than Hanako herself. She played the piano. Debussy's "Reverie." Why that piece? Why play a dreamy, introspective song while surrounded by stoic Japanese businessmen? Her golden fingers caressed the keys. I was mesmerized. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I listened. That's when I knew I had to finish this book. I had to meet this enigmatic woman and find out who Hanako Arasaka really was.			
People of Night City	Who is Dr. Paradox?	Who is Doc Paradox? Who's hiding behind the distorted mask?<br><br>Unsurprisingly, Doc Paradox won't say. After all, he's breaking the law - he has to protect his identity. If he revealed even the tiniest sliver about himself, NetWatch agents would be at his door in less than a minute.<br><br>But think about it. THINK. What kind of person could successfully hide from the world's most powerful corporations for years? Who could hack into encrypted T.V. channels? Who would disclose highly classified corporate secrets?<br><br>The answer's obvious. Doc Paradox is one of them. He's a puppet controlled by the establishment. To what end? Maybe this is how corporations funnel our anger and frustration in a safe and controlled manner, through a rebel who will never go so far as to issue a call to arms. Maybe he's being used to reveal "facts" that hurt the competition. Or maybe he's just a branding opportunity? In a month or two, Avante could put out a new, "Doc Paradox" line for us to wear our disapproval?<br><br>Only time will tell. But for christ's sake, don't listen to a word out of this phoney's mouth.

Religion and Philosophy	Anaphora of St. Cyril of Alexandria	We pray and beg for thy Mercy, Friend of Man, do not sentence us to Eternal Damnation, nor abandon those who are at your Service, nor banish us from your Sight, nor tell us you do not know our faces. Fill our Heads with Blessed Water, grant us a Well for our Tears so that we may weep for our Sins at thy Feet, for we are the humble Servants that graze in thy Pasture. Wipe away our Misdeeds and forgive us our Trespasses, whether committed willingly or unwillingly, consciously or unconsciously, in the Shadows or in Daylight, long forgotten or relinquished from our memory, for only thy Holy Name remains. Hear the pleas of thy People, look upon the suffering of thy servants, do not permit my Sins or the Impurities my own Heart lead thee to harden the Hearts of Others against the Holy Spirit.			
Religion and Philosophy	Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson	Even before our arrival, many beings in Babylon had lost their minds over this subject, while many others were inching closer to the same fate. The "burning question" of the day, the question that wracked the brains of both "pitiful scientists" and normal beings of Babylon was this:"Do we have a soul or not?" There were all sorts of the most fantastic theories on this subject, with new ones appearing all the time, and each and every one of the "tempting hypotheses" had its supporters. Despite the overwhelming number and diversity of these beliefs, they were all based on one of two completely opposing premises. The first was called "atheism," while the other was "idealism" or "dualism." All duelistic[sic] hypothesis held the soul existed and, of course, that it was immortal and could suffer many things even after the death of the being. Meanwhile, the atheistic theories held the complete opposite view. In short, my boy, when we cam to Babylon, we came upon what could only be called "constructing the Tower of Babel."			
Religion and Philosophy	Buddhism and Cyberware: A Perspective	Interviewer: For most of us, the precepts of Buddhism seem baffling to say the least. How would you explain to the average Night Citizen why bhikkhu such as yourself are against implanting cybernetic technology into their bodies?<br><br>Monk: It's not that we're against them, per say[sic]. Every person has the right to make choices with their body so long as those choices don't harm another. Though bhikkhu do abide by stricter rules, such as abstaining from cyberware, in order to achieve Enlightenment.<br><br>Interviewer: Then what does your hesitation stem from? How do cybernetics affect your pursuit of Enlightenment?<br><br>Monk: Well...(short pause) Among other things, it's their vague, fluid status... for lack of a better word. Ask yourself - what is an implant? A part of your body? An impersonal object?<br><br>Interviewer: You're asking me? Uh... (unintelligible) ...suppose I'd say it depends.<br><br>Monk: Precisely. Bhikkhu limit their possessions to a robe, umbrella, and a bowl for alms. Everything else is a distraction that hinders his or her release from the world's suffering. Let's say, for example, that a synthetic hand is just that - a hand, a part of your body. But if it has a watch installed in it? A blade?<br><br>Interviewer: Right, I think I understand. Where the line's drawn isn't completely clear.<br><br>Monk: Possessions - especially such intimate ones - are distractions that muddy the mind, that pull it further from inner peace. I believe the phenomenon of cyberpsychosis is proof enough of this truth.			
Religion and Philosophy	Earth Reborn	Our world is a world of people. Mankind has effectively eradicated any supernatural beings: mythical beings, folkoric creatures, gods - even the monotheistic God. Mankind has even given up hope of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, though little green men have been among us for some time already, paying us visits in their flying saucers. Only Man remains. And Man looked around and realized he was alone.<br><br>In his loneliness, Man felt the emptiness within him and started to repopulate it with beings other than himself. That is how artificial intelligence was created - from simple, deterministic robots obedient to their human masters, to becoming more intelligent and independent than Man could ever conceive. The unpredictability and power of artificial intelligence was greeted by Man with apprehension, but also with joy. Finally! Spirits and elemental forces have once again returned to our world! We could catalogue them - construct a hierarchy. We could fence them off behind the Blackwall and draw a new line between what is natural and supernatural - here is the Earth and here is the sky. How painful Man's solitude must have been if he had to create a palpable, technological mythology and surrender to the demons of his own creation!			
Religion and Philosophy	Homo Deus: Christianity and Cybermodification	"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God." So says the Book of Genesis. Religious components of cybernetic body modification believe the Christian God intended the same perfection for man as He Himself possesses. Suffering, disease, death - these exist in contradiction with divinity, but can be overcome with the aid of science and technology. So called "cybertheologists" interpret God's command to "subdue the earth" quite literally. By their account, any and all means that might enable man to reach a state closer to divinity are "good", both ethically and morally.<br><br>However, some in their Christian fold have voiced concern that such cybertheologists guilty of excessive hubris. For an immortal man would this become his own savior, rendering the existence of the one, true ascendant God superfluous. Only the soul should be immortal, while the human body - as a "temple of the Holy Spirit" - should be accepted as it is: mortal and destined for resurrection on Judgment Day.<br><br>"Eritis sicut dii," said the serpent to Eve: "You will be as Gods." Religious purists exhort their sisters and brothers in faith to resist this temptation of Satan, masked as the will of God. But cybertheologists have stood fast and supplemented their cause with the phrase "scientes bonum et malum". They call upon humanity to tap into the divine and cosciously interpret for themselves what is Good and what is Evil.			
Religion and Philosophy	Parallel Lives	It being my purpose to write the lives of Alexander the king, and of Caesar, by whom Pompey was destroyed, the multitude of their great actions affords so large a field that I were to blame if I should not by way of apology forewarn my reader that I have chosen rather to epitomize the most celebrated parts of their story, than to insist at large on every particular circumstance of it. It must be borne in mind that my design is not to write histories, but lives. And the most glorious exploits do not always furnish us with the clearest discoveries of virtue or vice in men; sometimes a matter of less moment, an expression or a jest, informs us better of their characters and inclinations, than the most famous sieges, the greatest armaments, or the bloodiest battles whatsoever. Therefore as portrait-painters are more exact in the lines and features of the face in which the character is seen, than in the other parts of the body, so I must be allowed to give my more particular attention to the marks and indications of the souls of men, and while I endeavor by these to portray their lives, may be free to leave more weighty matters and great battles to be treated of by others.			
Religion and Philosophy	Teachings of the Temple - Excerpts	The welcome truth that Sleep and Death are Twin Sisters, beneficent, healing and vivifying, is gradually making its way through the scientific as well as the religious world, bearing on its winos faith and trust in the fundamental lays of life which underlie all phenomena, and casting down forever the great Moloch of fear which stands at the gate of all men's minds, ready to devour each child of hope which has been conceived and born in the joy of life.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Time and Space are annihilated in dream life because of the rapid action of the energy of mind when freed from bonds of matter ; and life in a state of dream is a foretaste of what life may be when the coarser grades of matter which now hold the embryonic God-man in bondage are refined ; and the energy which now must act under all the difficulties man has ignorantly thrown up by unnatural, unwise methods and practices, through countless incarnations, will then be guided and controlled by the higher or Spiritual will of man, for the perfecting of a body as much superior to the bodies of the present races of mankind as the latter are superior to those of the animal creation.			
Religion and Philosophy	The Consciousness Curse	Man dies the way he was born: soft, weak and helpless. Death, the one certainty in this universe of chaos, can be both a tragic end and a release from suffering. It can come as an unexpected twist, or as a beautiful, crowning counterpart to a life well lived.<br><br>The curse we face as humanity, the only living beings in constant awareness of death, is our inordinate focus on the fact. How much happier is the life of the gazelle that escapes the cheetah's clutches, thinking that it evaded death once and for all, than the poor soul living out his days knowing each step inches him close to the void!			
Religion and Philosophy	The Coptic Bible	The Book of Enoch<br><br>...<br><br>And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: "Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children."<br><br>...<br><br>And all the others together with them took unto themselves wives, and each chose for himself one, and they began to go in unto them and to defile themselves with them, and they taught them charms and enchantments, and the cutting of roots, and made them acquainted with plants. And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three thousand ells: Who consumed all the acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another's flesh, and drink the blood. Then the earth laid accusation against the lawless ones.			
Religion and Philosophy	The Cult of Santa Muerte: Who is the Lady of the Night?	"We don't fear death. What's to be afraid of? Santa Muerte is a good friend, our close companion. We know how to talk to her and we know when there's no more room to negotiate." This is one of the first responses I heard while asking residents of Vista del Rey about Santa Muerte (Sacred Death). Her worship, officially condemned by the Roman Catholic Church but heavily influenced by its rites - is unusually popular among those of Mexican origin, and especially in Night City. Few realize that the cult finds its roots in ancient times. It's highly likely that Santa Muerte first arose as a fusion of the beliefs of the Aztecs, Mayans and other indigenous residents of South America with those of the Catholic Church, first brought to the continent centuries ago by the Spanish conquistadors.<br><br>Our Lady of Holy Death, also known as Lady of the Night (Señora de la Noche), is a fascinating deity. Her wide-ranging devotees include prisoners, gangsters and drug dealers, but also police officers, prostitutes and others who work under the cloak of night - in other words, anyone whose life is in constant danger. Even at the turn of the 21st century, persecuted members of the LGBT community would also pray to her.<br><br>Santa Muerte offers her protection to anyone who asks for it while leaving an appropriate offering on her altar: rum and tequila, fruit, cigarettes, candy or flowers. Interestingly enough, it is believe she does not distinguish between morally sound and morally questionable requests. Her worshippers pray for health and happiness, but also revenge or the death of their enemies. Everyone, no matter their request, must remember one thing - every prayer offered carries a price. If you don't pay, Santa Muerte will take someone close to you. And she would have every right to do so.<br><br>Santa Muerte is not just another cthonic goddess of the underworld. She is the saint of the rejected, the excommunicated, of those who feel somehow unfit to ask God directly to intervene. It should come as no surprise, then, that so many Night City residents consider her their patron.			
Religion and Philosophy	The Holy Bible: Old and New Testaments	Ecclesiastes 9 <br><br>For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn't know it; all is before them. (2) All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean, to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn't sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath, as he who fears an oath. (3) This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all: yes also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. (4) For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion. (5) For the living know that they will die, but the dead don't know anything, neither do they have any more a reward; for their memory is forgotten. (6) Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago; neither do they any longer have a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.			
Religion and Philosophy	The Myth of Er	Most curious, he said, was the spectacle - sad and laughable and strange; for the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life. There he saw the soul which had once been Orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women, hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers; he beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale; birds, on the other hand, like the swan and other musicians, wanting to be men. The soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and this was the soul of Ajax the son of Telamon, who would not be a man, remembering the injustice which was done him in the judgement about the arms. The next was Agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because, like Ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings. About the middle came the lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of an athlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after her there followed the soul of Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who chose, the soul of the jester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey. There came also the soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and his lot happened to be the last of them all. Now the recollection of former toils had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares; he had some difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of last, and that he was delighted to have it. And not only did men pass into animals, but I must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures - the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage, in all sorts of combinations.			
Religion and Philosophy	The World as Will and Idea	[...]But, besides all this, death is the great opportunity no longer to be I;—to him who uses it. During life the will of man is without freedom: his action takes place with necessity upon the basis of his unalterable character in the chain of motives. But every one remembers much that he has done, and on account of which he is by no means satisfied with himself. If now he were to go on living, he would go on acting in the same way, on account of the unalterable nature of his character. Accordingly he must cease to be what he is in order to be able to arise out of the germ of his nature as a new and different being. Therefore death looses these bonds; the will again becomes free; for freedom lies in the Esse, not in the Operari[...]<br><br>Arthur Schopenhauer			
Technology	75 Years of Cyberware, by Tsutomu Takahashi	INTRODUCTION<br><br>A century ago, losing a limb meant tragedy. It meant living with permanent disability, with severely reduced physical capability, and often with a chronic pain. What's more, people with disabilities frequently suffered from widespread discrimination, both active (e.g. employment bias) and passive or unconscious (e.g. poor infrastructural inaccessibility). Today, assuming the dismemberment victim is financially stable, loss of limb amounts to little more than a minor inconvenience.<br><br>A century ago, employers could impose specific dress codes, hairstyle regulations, and piercing and tattoo bans. Many even pressed their employees to maximize productivity often in violation of the law, such as through anti-pregnancy policies. At the time, however, deeper involvement with employees' bodies was simply impossible, legal or otherwise. But, with the advent of cyberware, employers in the second half of the twenty-first century have imposed requirements for skin, bone, muscle, organ and eye replacements in order to improve performance and workplace effectiveness In extreme cases, security sector employees are commonly urged to undergo so-called full body conversions, or full cyborgization.<br><br>Much has changed over the past seventy-five years from when cybernetic implants first hit the mass market. Many in the field of history of technology have argued cyberware is a positive force for progress, and many have argued the opposite. This book attempts to describe and contextualize the changes - for better or worse - that it has introduced to our professional and personal lives. How has cyberware led us to where we are today, and where is it taking us next?

Technology	Beyond the Border of Empathy	Last night on TV, I saw the following scene - a Militech squad in some debris-ridden corner of the Middle East, fighting the "enemy" - terrorists, political opponents... Shit, maybe they were just actors? It doesn't matter - it never really mattered in the first place. One of them was wearing recording equipment, scrolling a braindance. I can count on finding that fresh BD in any shop within days. Turn it on and bam! You're in a warzone. You feel what they feel. You taste the blood in your mouth and the reassuring grip of the scroller's rifle. But that's not the worst of it. The worst is how the editor will be sure to try to show off the rifle, get a good shot of the manufacturer's name. Another split-second and you'll be ready to buy the same exact one - even order it with the same dents and scratches. Free home delivery.<br><br>Only twenty or thirty years ago we were asking ourselves - when will we cross the border at which empathy becomes irrelevant? Now, standing in the shelled-out ruins of a home with a rifle in our hands, it's hard to believe that border ever existed.	Hailios	beyond_the_border_of_empathy	
Technology	Blaming Bartmoss - by 8ug8ear	When I imagine what the Net was like before Bartmoss, I see thousands of potential threats. And thousands of opportunities. Course, the whole system was unstable, corpo runners pulling one way, post-war rogue AIs pulling the other; financial markets tanked, virus mutation spiralled[sic] in uncontrollable ways, and runners got cooked in their living homes every now and then. Bartmoss saw the Net as a grenade waiting for the pin to get pulled. And that's exactly what he did.<br><br>Fuck it, right? Let the world burn.<br><br>Bartmoss fucked the system but fucked all of us right along with it. Just look at it now - corps are on top as usual, the Blackwall (which was supposed to protect us after the net's crash) is just another control tool in NetWatch's arsenal...<br><br>Before Bartmoss, the net was an untamed jungle - if you could navigate it, you had a chance to survive. You were free. After Bartmoss, the net's like an airport security check - every step you take NetWatch is checkin your papers and performing a thorough cavity search. Oh, but all for your own good, of course...			
Technology	Can cyberpsychosis be cured?	Can cyberpsychosis be cured? Opinions on that question are divided. Only a few years ago so-called braindance therapy was used across the entire country on a mass scale with the aim of bringing the sick back from the point of no return. The patient would be placed on a special chair and connected to a device that would deactivate all implants.<br><br>Then electrodes would be attached, inducing the patient into a coma-like braindance session. This was then followed up by medicine, psychosurgery and the aversion therapy.<br><br>The overall treatment was intended to sever all the patient's neural connections and tie them back together so that the cyberpsycho could return to society. Once the therapy was concluded, no symptoms of cyberpsychosis were detected, as well as the patient's former personality. But don't worry - nowadays other methods are used. At least, that's what they tell us.			
Technology	Chemicals: The Invisible Killer	We've long known that the AVs criss-crossing our skies are busy dumping harmful substances in the air, such as aluminum, carbon dioxide, sulphur trioxide and sulphuric acid. Studies have also revealed the presence of dead red blood cells and E coli., as well as sodium chloride (table salt).<br><br>Now, you don't need a degree in science to know the harm these substances can wreak on the body. We've found that sulphur compounds can lead to cancer, heart decease and other illnesses arising from a weakened or even damaged immune system. They can also lead to spontaneous dental hydroplosion and acute meningitis.			
Technology	Cyberware Usage and Its Side Effects	Many people believe we live in a time when "impossible" has become an obsolete term. Ripperdocs can replace nearly any part of the human body with artificial implants, from your big toe to portions of the nervous system. My years in Trauma Team, however, taught me that the "impossible" is still very much possible. Even now, as we enter the twilight of the twenty-first century, we as medical professionals have not been able to eliminate all of the side effects that come from incorporating cybernetic elements into our bodies. Of course, everyone is familiar with the mental disorder most commonly referred to as cyberpsychosis. But it doesn't end there. Although advances in medical science for the greater part of a century have reduced its incidence to a minimum, cyberware rejection can still occur in a small subset of the population. These unlucky few can experience a range of complications, but the following are the most prevalent:<br><br>1. Immune Response – The body rejects the implant, causing scar tissue to continue growing to the point that it causes pain and inflammation of surrounding tissue as well as possible interference with the tech's electrical circuits.<br><br>2. Psychological Effects – Neurological implants have the potential to cause unpredictable change in the brain. Possible side effects include depression, apathy, hallucinations and sudden increases in addictive behaviors, such as gambling.<br><br>3. Implant Overdependence – Long-term use of certain synthetic body part replacements can change the brain's chemistry to make it accustomed to a particular type of implant. There are reported cases of permanent blindness after patients attempted to replace their Kiroshi optical implants with different models.<br><br>In the face of these known risks, what should our outlook be as consumers and medical professionals? To deny ourselves cybernetic enhancements on the 0.5 percent chance we could lose our vision forever? Or gamble away our life savings at the casino? The clear answer is "No." Cyberware technology has elevated human biology to the point where these what-if arguments serve against our best interests. The best advice I can offer for minimizing your risk is to read the technomedical profiles for all cyberware you intend to purchase before you install it.

Technology	Pain Editors and Mortality Rates	Introduction<br><br>The implant known widely as the "pain editor" is cyberware that reduces or even entirely eliminates pain. It has enjoyed unwavering popularity for years among certain circles in Night City, the most devoted, and arguably most valuable, of which is mercenaries. It is using this test group that Zetatech conducted the following research.<br><br>The pain editor is a neural coprocessor that inhibits the signals sent from nociceptors to the parietal lobe of the brain, thus preventing feelings of pain in the user. (Note: Some models also reduce symptoms of fatigue.) The beneficial effects caused by the pain editor are in some ways similar to the symptoms of hypoesthesia, including greater resistance to physical forms of torture and the ability to ignore pain from severe wounds which can allow the user to continue perform beyond normal human limitations for a brief period.<br><br>However, some studies have reported that the pain editor can yield a range of undesirable side effects. For example, in the heat of battle, some users are unaware of the severity of their wounds, which causes them to continue fighting without realizing they are dying and require immediate medical attention. The statistics support the theory that a lack of negative reinforcement may cause users to continue fighting when the rational strategy would be to retreat and escape death. Since 2020, the mortality rate of pain editor owners is above 60 percent.<br><br>In this report, I address the question of how to better protect Zetatech clients from avoidable death while using our pain editors[...]

Preliminary testing shows emotional output at 75% conformity levels (Note: We are only concerned with the construct's matrix coherence, not with its perceived authenticity), while volition fluctuates at 80-90% conformity.<br><br>The success of the improved engram is largely owed to the use of experimental polyglycol structures as well as new synthetic granule neuron replicators within pseudomatrices (see Section 8764-03)<br><br>A precondition of activating the RELIC 2.0 is the ceasing of the host's vital functions (brain death, cardiac arrest). Only complete and irreversible shutdown of neural activity can allow the engram to root itself and take over the body (i.e. reboot). Clinical trials using subjects on the verge of biological death have proven unsuccessful in activating the RELIC 2.0's basic functionality.<br><br>In cases where subjects underwent biological death, upon taking root the biochip showed promising signs of initial activity prior to lapsing.

Technology	Relive.it - Braindance Quarterly	GUEST EDITORIAL<br><br>Braindance editors have long strived to strike a balance between real, lived experience and technological, experiential purity. The more heavily processed the material, the more abstracted the pathways, the clearer the braindance recording; these fundamental elements of design have guided editors since the first wave of brain-to-brain experience sharing technology took hold. In their pursuit of balance, however, editors have clearly shown a bias for purity over naturalism over the years, even going so far to use it as a point of pride in the quality of their production.<br><br>But in the industry's latest push for greater purity has the purpose of the technology already been forgotten? Will we not find ourselves processing and filtering a braindance recording to the point that the emotional experience no longer extends beyond what we receive from film, television and video games? After reliving some of the latest titles on my feeder unit, this once-academic question now feels all too inevitable with the industry's current trajectory.<br><br>For a moment, let's consider why some reports suggest more and more users are searching for unlicensed titles on the black market (so-called black braindances, extreme braindances, or XBDs). Are we so sure it's the illicit content they are after? Or maybe the real draw is the residual "grit" we editors try so hard to remove? Distracting thoughts, irrelevant memories, loose associative threads, emotions stretching beyond the desired spectrum... What if this "noise" is not so superfluous as we believe it to be? What if these peripheral experiences hold the potential to elevate a good braindance to an exquisite one? We do ourselves a disservice by not exploring these questions before our blind crusade for braindance purity leads this industry straight into the bin of obsolete, flash-in-the-pan technology.<br><br>- J.A.<br><br>Relive.it - The quarterly magazine for braindance editors, amateurs, and enthusiasts, vol. 4/78, December 2076			
Technology	Rewiring Synaptic Pathways	Chapter 1: The Future of Neurotechnology<br><br>The twenty-first century heralded a worldwide revolution in neurotechnology. We, as a society, can no longer image[sic] an existence without technologically heightened senses, enhanced memory capacity, and pain modulators. By linking our neural systems with computer chips, we are capable of learning complex skill sets in seconds - then subsequently forgetting them again the instant they are removed. Today, after nearly eighty years of increasingly incorporating these technologies into our daily lives, we must now ask ourselves: What comes next?<br><br>In recent years, the academic community has reignited discussions on possible new methods to influence brain plasticity. Is it possible to create permanent neural pathways using coprocessors? Can we expect a breakthrough regarding dopaminergic data manipulation in our lifetimes? If so, what will be the consequences? The probable emergence of commercially viable artificial neurotransmitters would undoubtedly reshape the health science field, yet would simultaneously introduce a potentially destructive tool to most governments and corporations. The field of plasticity maniuplation[sic] remains in its infancy, but most experts agree we should prepare for a future in which such neurological rewiring will become as commonplace as the cybernetic implants used so pervasively today. Studies should begin exploring now how science can adapt our bodies to optimize the effects of this technology while minimizing its abuse and potential unwanted side effects.

Technology	Sheet Metal and You: Your Guide to Autobody Repair	Just like you take care of your own body, so too should you care of your favorite four-wheeled friend. Many ask: when should I pull the trigger on making bodywork repairs? Simple answer: when it's no longer functioning at factory quality, typically as a result of collision damage, corrosion, damage from firearms, or general wear and tear.<br><br>But before you dive straight into the repairs, you should always first conduct a comprehensive survey of the damage. Not only the damage's nature but also the damaged part's core function in the vehicle as a whole should be thoroughly considered before choosing the best repair method.<br><br>Remember - always be sure to have the right set of tools handy before you begin with the repairs. And if there is any organic material still present in or on the vehicle (e.g. blood, bone fragments, etc.) always make sure to clean it thoroughly first. Do yourself a favor and don't make your job more difficult before you've even started.<br><br>But don't forget! Quality sheet metal is the most important piece to the car repair puzzle!

World	Accident or sabotage?	(...) despite a construction inspection and investigation by local authorities, the cause of the explosion remains a mystery. The incident occurred more than a week ago at a construction site in Pacifica, where foundations were being laid for the buildings of a new food & entertainment zone. Although the explosion did not damage the foundations - most likely, the center of the explosion was below their level - but work was halted immediately for fear of the structures collapsing.<br><br>Interestingly, despite the ongoing inspection and investigation, work on the site resumed just three days later, an increased count of Militech guards being the only change prior to the explosion.<br><br>When asked about the likely causes of the explosion, the developer ruled out human factors, such as a terrorist attack or sabotage. The building inspection report states the cause of the incident was a natural gas explosion.			yes

World	America After the War	AMERICA AFTER THE WAR:<br>THE TURBULENT YEARS OF 2024-2035<br><br>At the end of the Fourth Corporate War, in order to establish relative order under the federal government, President Elizabeth Kress imposed martial law on NUS member states and nationalized the domestic arms-manufacturing giant Militech. Preoccupied with their own internal issues, most of Europe and Japan paid little attention to developments in North America.<br><br>Back in the 1990s, corporations had already begun aggressively purchasing huge swathes of arable land from farmers. Those who were left with no choice but to sell eventually found each other and organized into larger groups, or "clans," to improve their odds of survival. Looking for reliable work opportunities meant staying on the move and often specializing transport contracts. Yet once the war settled down, their convoys became the single reliable, safe method of interstate shipping. In other words, this time of crisis and adaptation played a major role in the emergence of the so-called "nomad" social class.<br><br>Meanwhile, in the 2040s, NetWatch created a immense firewall, dubbed the Blackwall, to partition a safe part of the Net for human use and curb the threat of rogue artificial intelligences in cyberspace. At the organization's discretion, humanity was forced to sacrifice its access to inestimably valuable resources and knowledge for the sake of Net security.	Brear	america_after_the_war	
World	Arasaka Academy: Best of the Best, or Best for the Best?	Arasaka Academy emerged as the #1 ranked institute of secondary education in Night City for the fourth consecutive time according to the Night City Perspective's annual review. The periodical earns the lion's share of its advertising revenue from the academy's namesake corporation, though their editorial staff claim this financial cooperation does not influence their rankings. <br><br>The magazine's education experts claim Arasaka Academy's infrastructure has no equal in Night City. Bias or otherwise, we cannot argue them on this point. Lessons are primarily conducted via virtual reality or AI-generated lesson plans suited to a student group's specific needs. Public schools, meanwhile, can only dream... It comes as no surprise, then, that parents who are not gainfully employed at a megacorp are increasingly willing to incur a lifetime of debt for a chance to give their child a chance at the city's most prestigious education. <br><br>But there are many uncomfortable truths the Academy is struggling to keep silent. Academy administrators promote a culture of constructive competition among its pupils as a way to forge the world's next great corporate executives. A rat race by another name with a diploma at the finish line... <br><br>Night City Perspective factors placement in corporate leadership roles into their calculations, and with this criterion I take no issue. What they don't include, however, is the drop-out rate. The enormous pressures these students face inevitably translate to anxiety, depression and, for some, even suicide. These rates are especially high for students outside the Arasaka corporate family. Such is the dark side of Arasaka Academy's glowing reputation. <br><br>Thank you for reading and supporting independent journalism! Find more inconvenient truths, visit my blog.

World	Arvin Accord Redefined?	Ever since mayor Rhine[sic] declared Pacifica "an independent district", I keep wondering what it really means and what will the long-term ramifications of that decision be. Will it result in a small-scale war? 2070's Arvin Accord clearly defined Night City as free and autonomous, a result of Rhyne's efforts and political savvy. But as soon as the dust has settled, the mayor realized that some of the land he so valiantly fought for may be nothing more than dead weight as far as NC's welfare is concerned.<br><br>Dropping Pacifica from the administrative boundaries of the Free City of Night City has been a drawn-out process, since long-term action is always easier to digest by the public, but in reality, the district hasn't been considered a part of the city for a long time, by NC residents and even the NCPD, which withdrew from Pacifica years ago. But the official split came only when he needed to boost his support by massaging the crime stats.<br><br>So where did Pacifica find itself after the end of the Unification War? The Arvin Accord did not end the war, but simply moved it elsewhere without designating clear winners or losers or appeasing the ambitions of anyone involved. This is why a large independent district neighboring Night City would be a great catch for anyone vying for influence over the metropolis. The ambiguity of borders described in the Accord makes Pacifica a perfect location for everyone working in the shadows, and any kind of operations would not necessarily lead to breaking the 2070 treaty, but rather its creative reinterpretation.			yes

World	CHIBA 11	Every megacity has a center and a periphery, business districts and joyhouses - and no megacity is complete without one or two slums. These are neighbourhoods that even corpo suits are afraid to walk through, where the police don't respond to emergency calls, where the ambulances take the long way around, and where the rattle of gunfire never stops. In Night City it's Pacifica, in Berlin - Pankow, and in Tokyo - Chiba 11.<br><br>Those unlucky enough to be born in Chiba 11 usually end up facing two choices - join a gang and kill or be killed, or worm your way under a corp's protection. The suits in their glass towers look down on the lowlifes spawned in Chiba, but they're very well aware that if you save a person from abject poverty, they'll do anything for you without a moment's hesitation or guilty conscience. That's why Japanese zaibatsus open their doors to a select few from Chiba - the strongest, most determined, and above all, the most cunning. These supposedly fortunate souls are sent on the most lethal missions to the most dangerous corners of the world. Most die or disappear, but those who survive this trial by fire are welcomed back home as legends.			
World	Contemporary Netrunner Groups	Among all notable netrunner groups (or "cells") in recent years, Found in Translation has undoubtedly emerged as the most (in)famous. The four members of the group - known only by their aliases JD, AP, SK and BPM - primarily target major braindance studios and productions.<br><br>The first reported cyberattacks perpetrated by Found in Translation (FIT) were breaches of studio data fortresses that contained braindance files slated for release. They made slight adjustments to the recording data in order to replace positive emotions toward corporations with hot-blooded hate and to erase corporate logos that were planted for promotional purposes.<br><br>In July 2076, after a FIT-altered version of the braindance "Badlands Raid" hit the market in the Pacific Northwest, many consumers took to the streets of Seattle in a surge of violent anti-corporate riots. Following the incident, studios tightened security measures and law enforcement authorities formally recognized FIT as a terrorist cell that posed a significant risk to public safety and order. In response, FIT adapted its tactics; rather than solely launching attacks on braindance producers, they have begun to infiltrate domestic and commercial braindance units to corrupt or alter data. Their most recent data-manipulation attacks on the braindances "Wasteland Fury" and "Slave to the Supervisory Board" have cemented their repuation[sic] as a formidable netrunner cell that refuses to yield to outside pressure.

Hansen implemented a military command structure to establish and exercise control. His inner circle consists mostly of former Militech soldiers who served under him during Operation Midnight Storm (See OP/69/101c). BARGHEST has known links to criminal organizations on every continent (See CA/229/8/v1 and v2). These arrangements primarily involve the illegal trade and trafficking of weapons.

World	Dubai: Sand and Death	(...) I heard a troubling click. My Geiger counter - may it rest in peace. I stood on a glass surface, some parts smooth as ice, others cracked and jagged. The earth I walked on was formed from melted sand after a thermonuclear bomb detonated here - one of the five that fell on Dubai.<br><br>I recalled old stills from the end of the twentieth century: skyscrapers like crystal obelisks touching the sky, supercars, palm trees. Now - nothing. Like a surreal frozen sea blanketed by the irradiated dust of the Arabian Peninsula and glinting under the desert sun.<br><br>But nearby, in the city's former suburbs, life continues on. Difficult, brutal, cutthroat, but life nonetheless. Few dare venture outside without a hazmat suit, makeshift or otherwise. Any sort of dwelling must be built with concrete walls, measuring at least thirteen feet thick. And without a single window. This offers survival, yes, but to what end? Unlike in the corporate haven of New Dubai erected deeper into the Arabian Gulf, the average life expectancy in Old Dubai is a mere thirty years.<br><br>Still, some have found advantages to life here. No visitors. Neither NetWatch nor any corporate special forces unit will deploy here. This land of glass and dust has become asylum for some of the world's most wanted criminals. Some say they are only biding their time until an early death delivers them to hell. Some say they are already there.			
World	Excerpts from 'A History of the Nomads' by B.B. Pires	The First Nomad Code<br><br>1. Protect and respect your clan, and especially your family.<br><br>2. You are worth as much as your word.<br><br>3. Share with others in your clan.<br><br>4. Respect the privacy and well-being of your clan.<br><br>5. Never put your clan in danger.<br><br>6. Always take honest pay for honest work.<br><br>The New Nomad Code<br><br>1. Protect your family and clan - in that order.<br><br>2. Do not steal from anyone in your clan<br><br>3. Do not keep for yourself that which may help another in your clan<br><br>-----<br><br>It's hard to imagine a group less inclined to wandering than farmers, but in fact they were the people who dawned the age of nomads. Natural catastophes, crops ravaged by bioplagues, armed conflicts and martial law allowing corporations to speculate and privatize land - all this forced them into a life on the road. The first clans recognized as "nomadic" were the Aldecaldos and the Jodes, followed shortly after by Snake Nation, Thelas Nation, Folk Nation, Blood Nation and MetaCorp - a total of Seven Nations.<br><br>The nomad nations are divided into tribes, which are subdivided even further into clans and families. A family typically numbers between ten and a hundred people, while the biggest nations can reach up to a million.<br><br>At first, nomad activity was seen as anarchistic and subversive - mostly, as you can imagine, by corporations who quickly realized they wouldn't be able to control them. The biggest irony in all this is that it's thanks to the nomads that our cities were rebuilt after the wars and catastrophes that marked the first half of the 21st century. After all, families come together to build, not to destroy. (...)			
World	In the Shadows of Megabuildings	One could say we're living in stable times. The 4th Corporate War is ancient history, the Unification War is over and done with, and Night City is a free city - a jewel embedded between two Californias. Living here, you might have the impression that everything is OK in the world. But look around.<br><br>The world is not OK. Despite technological recession between 2020 and 2040 reducing global pollution levels, humanity is still facing monumental existential threats. Climate change has turned into climate disaster - its effects are irreversible and dangerously unpredictable. Hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods - natural catastrophes are growing in strength and frequency across the continent, leveling entire regions. Access to clean water is becoming increasingly more scarce, as well as fertile land. Hunger and starvation still reaps a bloody, human harvest in Asia and Africa, where corporations had no interest in building vertical, hydroponic farms.<br><br>Meanwhile, advances in cybermodification have given rise to a new problem: cyberpsychosis. And though we've been aware of cyberpsychosis for over half a century, and know that incidents of cyberpsychosis are inextricably linked to a person's level of implantation, we still do not know why some are more prone to carrying out violent attacks than others. Let's not also forget the more serious issue of mass inequality, record high crime rates (including in places like Night City) and social unrest linked to immigration in almost every corner of the world...<br><br>So I ask you again - look around. You see all of these problems in Night City already. Maybe you're standing in the shadow of a megabuilding and you think, "Night City is Night City - the rest of the world's problems don't affect me, right?"<br><br>Right?			
World	Inside MetaCorp	We associate nomads with chaos, societal collapse, technological backwardness... And for good reason! But there are always exceptions to the rule, and for the nomads, that exception are the Meta - more specifically, MetaCorp.<br><br>Unlike other nomad groups that deal in smuggling and raiding, the Meta are strictly law-abiding. MetaCorp, formally registered in the Western Corporate states, is a majority stakeholder in numerous shipping companies, including the rapidly-growing DTR (Decker, Tanaka & Rogers), which handled 53% of all of America's transport last year.<br><br>The story of MetaCorp is a story of American entrepreneurial spirit and confidence in the future - two things that not even a nuclear war could destroy. Indeed, MetaCorp only proves that a new order can rise out of entropy, that the rustle of eurodollars is capable of civilizing even the most savage barbarians.<br><br>Last month I had an opportunity to visit the company's headquarters in MetaKey, the mobile island currently anchored in the Gulf of Mexico. There I met Victoria Meta, the corporation's nomad CEO and granddaughter of MetaCorp's founder, Jonathan Meta. Victoria had clearly inherited his steely gaze... and enterprising mind.			
World	Lat-Am Wars	As a direct result of the armed conflicts on U.S. soil from the early 1990s until the early 2000s, Latin America (comprising South and Central America) remodeled itself into a strong federation of independent nations, bound through mutual aid and cooperation.<br>The U.S.'s military presence was forced from Latin American territories with the exception of Panama, where it stood its ground despite fierce pressure from guerilla forces.<br><br>Many researchers and contemporary historians maintain that, in fact, the Lat-Am Wars were responsible for the U.S.'s eventual collapse, breaking up the Gang of Four (CIA, FBI, DEA and NSA) and decimating the U.S. Army. However, it's important to bear in mind that no external conflict could have toppled the colossus of American imperialism were it not already built on clay foundations.			
World	Mystical Rapture in Film	The supernatural as a subject has begun to disappear from film over recent years, yet another symptom of the world sliding from the spiritual realm into a profane cesspool of materialism laced with realism.<br><br>That is why "Brides of Satan," a film detailing the sexual escapades of medieval villagers in the pits of hell, deserves all the more attention. The seemingly hackneyed plot gives rise to deeper questions on the nature of good and evil, reminding us of mankind's ultimate helplessness against the power of Satan, who has one singular aim: to ravage the feeble, trembling human soul.<br><br>"Brides of Satan" is a must-see film for anyone interested in themes such as axiology and medieval European history.

World	Night City and the Painful Return to Normality	NIGHT CITY AND THE PAINFUL RETURN TO NORMALITY. Rebuilding Night City's center after the terrorists' nuclear attack was no easy feat. Along with the end of a global conflict, known as the 4th Corporate War, the United States entered a period of unrest, resulting in the then president Elizabeth Kress forbidding one of Night City's largest employers, the Arasaka Corporation, from conducting business in the USA. Instead of offering help to rebuild Night City, America's leaders urged residents to abandon their homes, writing the city down as a loss.<br><br>Scattered and desperate, they could have easily lost hope, but the proud Night Citizens ignored the authorities' instructions, decided to remain and bring the city back to its former glory. The Night Corporation offered full-body conversions for those who agreed to work in radioactive zones and clear hazardous debris. To cope with overcrowding, dozens of new megabuildings rose up from the rubble. The design of these one-size-fits-all structures expanded on the idea of vertical malls from the previous era, adapted to suit the needs of thousands of tenants and consumers. Finally, in 2052 the mission to rebuild Corporate Plaza began. The message to the world was clear: Night City is re-opening for business!			yes
World	Night shipment	The freighter Tristesse des Caraïbes has set off from Port-Au-Prince. It should sail into Night City by tomorrow midnight.<br><br>Make sure only the 30% of dockworkers on our payroll are scheduled for the night shift.

Screw this up and heads will roll.<br><br>-Pompadour			yes
World	Outer Space! My Life in Orbit	What's life in space like? Comfortable.<br><br>Of course, not everything's a bed of roses. Gravity below 1g isn't great for your bones or muscles. Synthesized food isn't to die for, and stuff from Earth is as rare as it is expensive. If you live in a private orbital station (congrats, you're richer than me!), you always see the same faces. But if you live in a hybrid station like Crystal Palace, you'll have to live with corporat[sic] bachelor parties every weekend. But don't let that put you off! There are more upsides than downsides to living in orbit.<br><br>First of all: safety. To get into orbit you need a lot of zeroes in your bank account, which means you won't see legions of homeless people, skezzed out gangsters or aggressive joytoys (the exception to that being the Lunar colonies, but no self-respecting Orbital-dweller would ever set foot there). In other words - you can walk outside at night unarmed, without security, and come back home in one piece, wallet undisturbed. Amazing, right?<br><br>Secondly: quality of service. Anyone in the customer service sector had to rack up an enormous debt to come up here. Their only hope to pay it off within their lifetimes is to rake in a lot (and I mean A LOT) of tips, which means they'll bend over backwards to satisfy every whim. if you're an employer, you don't have to worry that an employee you just hired and trained at your expense will suddenly quit and go work for the competition for a few extra eddies a week. Many stations, especially the private ones, simply don't have competition, and if they do it's basically negligible - agreements can be made so situations like that don't occur.<br><br>Thirdly, and most importantly: no government can tell you what to do, where and how. Orbital stations are autonomous and governed by their own laws... and there aren't that many of them. If you can afford your own station, you're the undisputed lord and master of your little corner of space. You want to tie the help up to a whipping post when they make a mistake? Go right ahead. Want five wives or four husbands? I'm sure you'll have a line of willing volunteers.			
World	Pacifica - Haiti Reborn: A Look at Postreligion and Technomysticism	When the people of Pacifica mention the name Agwe, they do not refer to the ancient Vodou deity, the patron loa of sailors, the captain of the ship Immamou that transports souls across the seas to Guinee. Their thoughts are of Philippe Oreste who sailed to Haiti though the waves, winds, and torrential rains of a tropical storm to save 150 lives and guide them to safety atop pneumatic rafts. When Oreste and the other refugees finally arrived in Night City following a short time wandering in search of shelter and a new life, his legend was born. He became the new Agwe.<br><br>The Agwe of yore eventually faded from memory along with Erzulie, Legba, and the other loa of old Haiti, for they could not look after the people as the nascent Voodoo Boys of Night City had come to do. The Voodoo Boys care for their own. Outsiders be damned.<br><br>What is Pacifica now? The oasis of the Haitian diaspora. The muttering of superstitious old women. The distrustful gaze when unwanted guests arrive unannounced. The lullabies of a bygone era... Si ou pa dodo krab la va mange'w...			
World	Pathfinder: Half a Century of Silence	When, in the summer of 2020, NASA's Pathfinder mission set off for Jupiter, it was the buzz of every radio station, TV media outlet, and screamsheet. Stills of the crew were plastered on every type of commemorative merchandise imaginable: mugs, shirts, plates, bobbleheads, bumper stickers, the list goes on.<br><br>But, just a week later, the steady stream of information dried to a tickle. A month later, the world had all but forgotten about them. Three years later, and two years before their planned entry into Jupiter's orbit, a conflict now known as the Fourth Corporate War broke out.<br><br>Cape Canaveral was one of the first strategic sites razed to the ground - NASA's mission control center along with it. Pathfinder, in the vast reaches of space, had been cut off. When the opposing sides finally signed a truce three years later, Militech set its sights on reestablishing contact with the Pathfinder crew, but to no avail. Pathfinder's signal, it seemed, had been swallowed by the void of the Big Black.<br><br>To this day, it remains unknown whether the Pathfinder mission was a success. If the crew ever did reach Jupiter and its moons, we have received no word, no data, not a single lead to follow. Maybe they never stood a chance. Maybe, after a half-century of silence, they simply have nothing to say to us.	Rampakslue	pathfinder_half_a_century_of_silence	
World	Protein Farms: A Report	Protein farms are currently the source of most meat and meat-substitute products in Night City. Biotechnica is the clear industry leader, providing for over half of the city's demand for alternative protein. Currently, the most popular, albeit cost-intensive form of production is based on protein-rich crickets, which allow producers to achieve the highest-quality protein. Earthworms are available as a cheaper alternative, achieving a higher yield of product per square meter. However, worms pose a more difficult marketing challenge - while crickets have become acceptable, most consumers still bristle at being told to "go eat worms."	Lycan	protein_farms_a_report	
World	Remember the RED DECADES!	Let's be real - what kind of person was Elizabeth Kress? Does she really deserve monuments or streets named after her?<br><br>Elizabeth Kress Street near the confines of Night City is a twisted joke. Once again the 1% try to shove NUSA/Militech propaganda down our throats and force us to swallow it. It's a lie perpetuated by the elite in an effort to evoke an illusionary patriotic sentiment.<br><br>This is not enough to whitewash history - not enough to make us forget the ruins on which Night City was built, the red cloud of devastation hanging over the continent, the rain thick as blood.<br><br> By building this district, by building Kress street, this is what we see. Not a "president of the people", but the violence that her name recalls. Violence and scorched earth. Nuclear devastation. The RED DECADES!			yes

World	Smuggling	(...) If you want to transport goods, you need contacts. Without contacts, forget about doing business. Who will you need to pay off? Customs officers, guards, the people at the gas stations. Don't forget the motels. You take care of that, you can show up and vanish as you please. Keep them happy and they'll know when to turn a blind eye. It's also a good idea to strike a rapport with the fellows from Orbital Air - that is, if you're planning to ship something into orbit. Remember those boxes full of seedlings last year? That could only have happened because my boys at OA customs looked the other way for fifteen seconds.<br><br>Make sure you're well-equipped. Don't use standard signal jammers - customs agents aren't stupid - they'll know you're hiding something at the border, besides which there are no models they can't disable. Use upgraded jammers that work hyper-locally, in the exact place you're hiding the goods. Secure packages with ICE, ideally bought from us. You can trust family.<br><br>Use your imagination. Do you know how I managed to transport a few dozen pounds of drugs to SoCal? I paid the right people not to ask any questions and hitched a ride with an All Foods convoy. Nobody realized that several containers of food were packed full with drugs.<br><br>Plan your routes carefully. You have up-to-date border patrol routes and areas scanned in real-time by corporate satellites. And you have good ol' American roads. Use backroads and routes that corpo convoys would rather avoid. You can also dance around those old minefields since the corps don't patrol there anymore, although apparently by now they know we pass through there and it's only a matter of time. Use the tunnels as a last resort. These days it's usually a one-way trip - you go through one and the second you're out the satellites have a lock on you. So in case you do - step on it. And most of all, brothers and sisters - don't get caught.			
World	The Day the Tower Fell	In early August 2023, a single event would change the course of history. Although it fell against the bloody backdrop of the Fourth Corporate War, the global media still fed on the story for weeks. And could you blame them? A group of terrorists detonated a nuclear bomb, blowing Arasaka Tower to pieces. The terrorists' warning came too late - not all of the Tower's employees could be evacuated. The blast itself killed and wounded thousands, while countless others died from radiation sickness. How did the biggest terrorist attack in the 21st century happen? Who was behind this catastrophe? To find the answers, we'll need to first understand the context of that era.<br><br>The early 2020's was a period of unrest for Night City and anti-corporate sentiment was at an all-time high. In the epicenter of the city's lawlessness stood the Atlantis club. It was seen as an island of resistance against the powers that be, primarily megacorporations like Militech or Biotechnica - though a special place in hell was reserved for Arasaka, the Japanese arms-manufacturing zaibatsu that held the most influence over Night City. The kinds of people who frequented the Atlantis felt that corporations had hijacked the future and turned people into consumer-slaves and ironically, deprived of the two things capitalism loved most - freedom and choice. These people called themselves Edgerunners. They positioned themselves against the corporate world order - they declared their own freedom and opposition to the status quo. But deprived of any peaceful way to meaningfully change what they called "the System," they reached for more radical methods of self-expression. And these people were no strangers to violence.			
World	The Fall of the Bakkers	The indirect cause of the family's weakening in leadership was - paradoxically - not enough internal opposition within the group. Decisions made by Selita Bakker, the charismatic and surprisingly long-lived leader - were made without so much as a grumble, and her orders were carried out immediately. Selita led the Bakkers with an iron fist - she was a domineering figure, perhaps overwhelmingly so, but you couldn't call her a tyrant. Loved and respected by all, toward the end of her life she seemed to regret that nobody in the family tried to take power or at the very least challenge her authority.<br><br>After her death, the family entered a transition period - Selita's position was occupied successively by DeLou Bakker, Lorna Ruiz and Chari Dahlin. None of them led the family for more than two years (DeLou died during a skirmish with Raffen Shiv, Lorna resigned, and Chari simply collected her things and disappeared from the camp one day). It seems that the family depended so long on Selita that when she was gone nobody could make any firm, unilateral decisions.<br><br>The family's subsequent leaders ruled "without any conviction," in the words of Trin Bakker, who like many other young members left the Bakker family after it decided to merge with Snake Nation.<br><br>Trin: When I looked at DeLou or Chari, I had the impression they had an invisible sign over their heads that said, "What would Selita do?" Lorna was all right, but she drank too much. To be honest, I don't blame her. I think grandma's heart would break if she saw how quickly her successors went through the family's supplies and tore up contracts and agreements with other clans. And the idea to join Snake Nation? We might as well have asked Raffen Shiv to line us up on the dirt and execute us. What's the difference? That was the true end of the family. That's why I, Ossian, Lil Elam, Afshin, Persia and others decided to leave.<br><br>S.W.: Do you still keep in touch?<br><br>Trin: No.			
World	The False Rumors Circling Busan	Conspiracy theorists have recently been roused by news of alleged human activity in the ghost city of Busan. Our younger readers may not recall that the Korean city - formerly four million strong - was wiped off the face of the Earth during the 4th Corp War. Unofficial sources out there point the finger at Militech, whose tendencies of tyranny led to the creation and spread of lab-drown, deadly virus. Accident, experiment, whatever the truth - the virus proved so--ahem--virulent that the United Korean gov still won't lift the strict quarantine on Busan all these decades later.<br><br>So why did all these tabloid-junkies and sensation-seekers all the sudden become so interested in the dead city again 50 years later? A Seoul-based detective unearthed satellite image showing signs of life. Well, technical "life" that is, in the form of active machinery. But no real surprise there. After all, Busan was one of the world's most heavly automated metropolises. It was a human virus, not the computer variety. Many of the robots go out their work, their repairs, their trash scooping and sorting. These mystery sat images? Just some computers that never got turned off. That's it.<br><br>The people of United Korea can sleep easy tonight knowing Busan is a ghost town in the metaphorical sense only.			
World	The MaxTac Way, by Mathias Maddox	FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION<br><br>I was fortunate, after publishing the first edition of this book, to meet many people with fascinating stories. I spoke with people who lost loved ones at the hands of cyberpsyshos. I met the relatives of people whom I shot. Needless to say, not every conversation ended on good terms.<br><br>After some time, I learned what questions to expect from my readers. Have you ever been shot? (Yes, and I've lost count.) Who was the most difficult person to kill/arrest? (The 2063 Golden Springs Mall Killer - more titanium bone and synth-skin than man.) What causes cyberpsychosis? (I'll let you know when I find out!)<br><br>Then, at a book-signing in Heywood, I was asked a question I had never heard before: Is there anything that keeps me awake at night? After a moment's reflection, I realized the answer was yes. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, it was not nightmares of eviscerated cyberpsycho victims, nor the shrieks and cries of my squad mates as they burned alive. Cruel as it may sound, I grew used to that. It was just part of the job. No - what caused my heart to pound as I lie in bed late at night is the thought that one day I, too, could succumb to cyberpsychosis. The amount of cyberware I have incorporated into my body is substantial. Far more than most. I tried to drown the human parts of me that fear, that doubt. I am aware just how fragile my humanity is - that piece of myself deep within that makes me who I am. One poorly clipped neuron, one hormonal overdose, and that piece may disappear forever, leaving behind an automoton with only one desire: to kill. In truth, I forced my mind to race so I would not have to confront these thoughts. Today, I still struggle with these demons, but I have asked my wife to keep a loaded pistol in her bedside table. If I begin to scream or rant incoherently in the middle of the night, I instructed her to empty the entire clip between my eyes. At first she objected, but our love is strong.<br><br>It is thanks for my loving wife's promise that I have never slept as soundly as I do now.			
World	The Psychos of MaxTac	If a psychotic killer is prowling the streets, they're supposed to defend us. If your average Joe Blow goes ballistic in his cubicle, they're supposed to bag him and drop him off at the psych unit. They're supposed to make us feel safe in a world of madness. But be honest with yourself - have you ever really felt safe in the presence of MaxTac?<br><br>What the mainstream media won't tell you is that ninety percent of MaxTac interventions end in the killing of the cyberpsycho. And if you confront anyone about it, the official word is they "only take life when absolutely necessary." but don't buy into their bullshit! For them, the kill is a MUST. To keep bystanders happy with a display of bloodstained justice! And if a few civilians die? Tough. They'd say it's just a necessary evil for the greater good. Only... whose good, exactly?<br><br>I witnessed one of these interventions firsthand. The cyberpsycho stormed into a mall, armed to the teeth and shot seven people before slipping into a detached state of calm, mumbling God knows what to himself. MaxTac arrived after a few minutes and immediately opened fire. The gunfire jolted the psycho back into a frenzy. By the time MaxTac "secured" the area, twenty-five people had died. What a heroic success, huh?<br><br>You waiting for a bottomline? Here it is. ALL MaxTac members used to be CYBERPSYCHOS themselves. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. The same people who butchered innocents on the streets just a month, a week, a day earlier are now are now our knights in shining armor.<br>Is it any surprise nearly each of their "interventions" ends in an "unavoidable" massacre?<br>Just some funny coincidence?! You tell me!			
World	The Truth about Cyberpsychosis	I've had enough of the senseless shootings that claim hundreds of innocents every day. I'm sick of the satire on empty, deadend implant-restriction dialogue. I'm tired of ignoring the cyberpsychosis problem.<br><br>In American society today, there are still a lot of common myths and misconceptions about the so-called technology-related personality disorders. People think they can become "infected" in sketchy ripperdoc clinics. Scientists allegedly disagree about the causes of the disease, or even about whether it exists at all. Maybe their tune would change if a cyberpsycho turned their lab into a slaughterhouse. But even then, I doubt it. They're not getting fat paychecks from the cyberware lobby just to openly declare to the public all the nasty possible side effects that come packaged with their products.<br><br>I've conducted my own research on cyberpsychosis. With supreme confidence, I can confirm this illness is, indeed, a by-product of the modern lifestyle and the obsessive emphasis placed on incorporating modern tech into our lives. Although cybernetic implants can directly affect our brain chemistry, they still serve only as a catalyst for the onset of the disease.<br><br>Our world is subject to extensive dehumanization. We surround ourselves with increasingly more automated machines and artificial intelligences. Our loved ones replace their nature-given eyes, lips and faces with masks of metal. Some of us begin to lose sight of what is human; we slip into feelings of total alienation and deep-rooted panic. We lose the ability to distinguish between what is real and what is "only" artificial, digital, synthetic... Such people begin to isolate themselves, lose their empathy for others, and undergo dramatic mood swings that exhibit sadistic tendencies. The most frightening component to all of this, however, is that most will never be diagnosed.<br><br>Not all cyberpsychos are known war veterans or former mercenaries equipped with Sandevistan reflex tech. Not all will go out in a blaze of gunfire with MaxTac. Many cyberpsychos in our world possess only a single implant; a knee, a liver. They are unseen, unnoticed. They lock themselves up and shut out their friends, colleagues, and loved ones. The world outside of the Net and their delusions has disappeared from conscious thought. They are sick and alone - and no[sic] is doing a thing about it.<br><br>There is no eloquent summary to be made here. Let the value of this manifesto be measured by the fact that I was expelled from the Zetatech cybernetics research team for having written it.			
World	The Undoing: Fall of the First Net	Chapter I: The Apocalypse<br><br>His name was Rache Bartmoss. Everyone knows WHO destroyed the first Net. The real question is WHY. NetWatch branded him a criminal and outlaw. The media called him a madman. Is either label correct? You be the judge. Below is a previously unpublished letter which Bartmoss put out just before the release of R.A.B.I.D.S. Why has this document only now just emerged? Well... Someone out there did not want you, my dear readers, to ever lay eyes on it. All the more reason to take a deep dive into the information available to us.<br><br>-- Maria Jimenez<br><br>-----<br><br>The first Net was supposed save[sic] us. It would serve as a platform for those without a voice. It would offer unlimited knowledge to those who hungered for it. It would bring a fractured humanity closer together than ever before in our history. But these hopes were hollow. False.<br><br>The Net spread its tendrils around the globe faster than anyone could have predicted. Before anyone could even consider the full range of consequences. This "information superhighway" turned out to be our path straight to hell. We were robbed of our privacy, deprived of our free will, stripped of our dignity.<br><br>It was supposed to save us, but now even the Net itself cannot be saved. It was molded by the corps, with sharp edges, spikes and traps at every corner. Think of the Net as a stream of water that flows gently into our minds... before freezing, swelling, and destroying us from the inside out. But remember this about ice - as hard as it may be, it's surprisingly brittle. One well-placed strike and it shatters into a million tiny pieces. Watch out today and you'll see just what I mean.<br><br>Rache Bartmoss			
World	The Unification War... for Gonks!	*The Unification War is the most recent armed conflict to take place in North America since the Collapse, lasting from January 2069 to June 2070.<br><br>*Although the Unification War is formally recognized as a war between the New United States of America (NUSA) and the governments of the Free States, most scholars also classify the conflict as a corporate war. It is well known that the NUSA was backed by Militech hardware, personnel and other resources, whereas the Free States received the significant yet tacit support of the Arasaka Corporation.<br><br>*The Unification War is also sometimes referred to as the Metal War or Metal Wars, in reference to wide use of armored calvary units (so-called "panzers").<br><br>*The bloodiest battle in the Unification War was the Battle of Ridgecrest. In just one day, at least 3,078 people were reported killed.<br><br>*North California and South California were on opposite sides of the war, allied with the Free States and the NUSA, respectively, while Night City maintained a position of neutrality.<br><br>*The Unification War ended when all parties signed the Treaty of Unification in Arvin, South California. Both sides claimed victory: the Free States emphasizing that they had preserved their independence, and the NUSA boasting that they were closer than ever to reunifying[sic] a divided American people.<br><br>*The end of the Unification War, however, was not an end to conflict at large. The leading AI analytics software predicts another hot war will likely break out by 2080 (74% confidence).			
World	THE WARSAW CATHOLIC FAITH AND ITS ORIGINS	As Saint Augustine of Hippo taught us, to err is to be human, but to err willingly is to perform the work of Satan. Pope Ferdinand I and his successors are guilty of this heinous sin for their perversion of Christ's teachings and their worship of the golden calves of technology and Mammon. They have not only chosen this path to perdition for themselves but have attempted to tempt the Lord's flock to follow. For the sake of the millions of eternal souls he loves so dearly, Cardinal Konrad Lewandowski made the only decision God would allow. Seeing that the Vatican had renounced our Lord and Savior, he rescinded his nomination to head the Holy See and instead rested the weight of the newly founded Polish Papacy on his shoulders and moved the seat of the Church to Licheń, Poland.<br><br>1. What do Warsaw Catholics believe? <br><br>Warsaw Catholics worship the one, true God and recognize family as defined by the laws of nature our Lord has provided and in accordance with the traditions hallowed by the blood of our ancestors.<br><br>2. When you say "I believe in God," what do you mean? <br><br>It means we acknowledge the truth that there is one true God whose wisdom is infinite and unchanging, who commands our obedience, who compels us to raise a families founded on love and faith, who has tested Poland with great suffering as He tested Job, thus demonstrating that Poland is God's chosen land.<br><br>3. Through whom did God reveal what we are to believe? <br><br>His only son, Jesus Christ, whose earthly voice is now spoken through the Pope as elected by the Polish Episcopal Conference.<br><br>4. Why believe the word of God? <br><br>Because only through faith can we be saved and find eternal peace in Heaven. Only through faith can we be true Poles, worshipping, thinking, and speaking in Polish in accordance with the customs of our fathers and mothers.			
World	United Under the Stars and Stripes, by Rosalind Myers	The twentieth century brought upon us great tragedy: nuclear war, catastrophic climate change, widespread hunger. Worst of all: the dissolution of the United States of America. Our great nation has often been forged and reforged in the polarizing fires of internal struggle. North against South. Democrat against Republican. Corporations against Federal Government. But we, as a people, knew how to temper this discontent and become stronger for it; even by force in our darkest hours. This has always been and continues to be our moral duty to the land we love and serve.<br><br>Humankind had never before known a nation like the United States. We were soldiers, the protectors of the free world. Our armies maintained order, our universities fueled innovation and progress, our industry spurred growth and prosperity, our press voiced the truths of our collective conscience. But when the United States tragically collapsed so, too, did civilization.<br><br>The time comes again, as it has so many times before, for America to rise up and set the world on a new trajectory of hope. However, we can only achieve our goals of a better tomorrow if we do not lose sight of who we are. We must now rally together beneath our star-spangled banner of these New United States. We must push aside those corporations and rogue states who denounce and would deny our pursuit of happiness. We must sacrifice them for our common good. I ask you to fight against those who would divide us. With debate. With pride. With blood and iron.			
World	Water, Chrome and Blood - THE FOURTH CORPORATE WAR	(...) It is truly remarkable that the large-scale bloodshed of the Fourth Corporate War began first as a simple rivalry between two ocean exploitation corporations: CINO and OTEC. Both companies vied for the controlling stake of the failing IHA corporation. OTEC commissioned Militech to secure its business interests and perform certain "special operations." CINO, in turn, signed a cooperation agreement with the Arasaka Corporation with a similar aim. When circumstances at last called for both colossal and prideful security corporations to clash in open combat, the Fourth War had officially begun.<br><br>Yet, as is usually the case with corporate conflicts, the onset proved subtle: Arasaka disables a Militech transport, Militech (allegedly) eliminates a high-ranking official of an Arasaka client, both sides engage in frequent sabotage and data theft operations, netrunners from both sides infiltrate dataforts to sow confusion, gather intel and cause chaos in the stock markets. Though none would have thought it possible in those early months, the Arasaka-Militech conflict truly jeopardized the stability of the world economy, making the threat of complete economic collapse all too real. For this reason, NetWatch introducted[sic] a communications embargo on both corporations. This did little to slow the conflict's pace, however. While CINO and OTEC had unilaterally reached a settlement and reach an understanding through "peace talks," tension between Arasaka and Militech continued to rise. This separation from the ocean dispute marks the beginning of the Fourth War's second phase: the so-called Shadow War.<br><br>Military clashes between Militech and Arasaka were notoriously bloody, brutal and without mercy, they waged their most damaging campaigns on the Net. Arasaka and Militech netrunners launched attacks with the help of viruses that were often highly experimental. What's more, they created lethal ICE measures and AI-like programs that could lurk in dark corners of the Net for long periods to make strikes at the most opportune times.<br><br>By the second half of 2022, Arasaka and Militech entered the final phase of the conflict where both sides used every resource and strategy at their disposal. The Hot War had begun. Around this time, the Net that the world had known for years ceased to exist, and mercenaries hired by both corporations were slaughtered in open warfare fought with the cutting-edge weapons technology. Then, in the War's most shocking and iconic turning point, the coup de grâce came when an unknown group of mercenaries denoted a nuclear device at Arasaka's Night City headquarters. Shortly after the blast, bowing under increased pressure from the Japanese government, Arasaka laid down its arms and withdrew from many of its strategic positions, but most notably in Night City. Victory belonged to Militech, but it came at a heavy cost. (...)			
World	Why Be Me?: Confessions of a Braindance Addict	PREFACE<br><br>Do you want to be you?<br><br>Seriously. Take a moment to let that question sink in. Do you feel at home in your skin? Do you like your job? Your friends, your family? When you look in the mirror, do you say to yourself "I'm the luckiest person alive," then hop in the leather-upholstered backseat of your chauffeured Rayfield?<br><br>If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, put down this book and stop wasting your valuable time. If you answered "no" to the above, I understand how you feel.<br><br>It used to be said, at the turn of the century, that the world belongs to the "one percent." Today, one thousandth of a percent is closer to the truth. And your chances of joining this group are even less than that. In this reality, I mean - where you are you. In a braindance, you can be anyone. A broker who manages a portfolio worth trillions. An elite soldier who blasts his enemies out of existence with a tech shotgun.

World	Yōkai: Japanese Demons of Yesterday and Today	They make their homes on mountaintops, in rivers and oceans, on city streets and on every megabuilding floor with the number 4 in it, even in your washing machine or infovisor. Some appear in concrete places, while others simply haunt a specific person. They're there when you hear a strange noise in the middle of the desert. They're there when you feel like someone's watching you, although there's not a soul in sight. They're there when you glimpse something out of the corner of your eye, something nobody else seems to notice, but you were just at the ripperdoc's for your checkup!<br><br>The yōkai first appear in Japanese literature in the year 797. These mysterious beings, though closely linked to the invisible realm of the dead, have been alive in the Japanese consciousness from the very birth of animism. It's not that the Japanese believe in the yōkai. They simply know the yōkai exist.<br><br>[...] In addition to phantoms, ogres and other mysterious phenomena, the yōkai also include a group of shape-shifting demons called obake or bakemono. The bakemono are said to sometimes take the form of a faceless person, a one-eyed scarecrow or an animal.<br><br>[...]It's said that when a cat reaches a certain age, it becomes a bakeneko. These yōkai are able to walk on their two hind legs, speak and dance, assume human form or even devour their owners and take their place. The bakeneko sometimes visit people in their sleep, or even wake the dead – all they have to do is hop over a corpse to bring it suddenly back to life.<br><br>However, the demons are capable of much, much more. One should exercise extreme caution around a double tailed cat. This is a nekomata, a yōkai with shamanic and necromantic capabilities, able to place curses on people and control the dead. In its human form, a nekomata resembles an old woman, often one addicted to some substance or other and with an eerie, disturbing air about her.<br><br>However, let me assure American readers of this book; today, the most likely place you'll find a bakeneko is in the form of lucky Maneki-neko figurines. After all, real cats are an even rarer sight these days than your average yōkai.
